\p Of all the people who have helped with the production of this book, foremost is my wife, helpmate, and co-laborer in this work, Cindy. She forbore many weeks of my inattention and distraction as I wrote this. Then she took up her very able “correction-pen” to make extensive editorial changes. Because she deeply understands every part of this material, she could not only make it more readable, but make it convey more clearly the message that needed to be told.
\p Next, I need to thank Dan Servatius whose walk with the Lord through many difficulties has been an encouragement to me. He lent his quick eye and diligent reading to find numerous grammatical and spelling errors. Romeo Garcia, my long-time traveling companion in this discipleship journey, helped with the initial chapters by challenging me to look at what I wanted to say from the outside-in rather than the inside-out.
\p The concept of using scripture based discovery studies to teach disciple making came out of the cooperative work of the group of men and women who besides being involved in their own ministries, have been working to implement DMM in the Twin Cities. This group includes: Tom Mouw, Mike Neterer, Randy Torpen, Phil Bickel, Dave Engman, Jay Perske, Sergio Amezcua, Paul and Roxane Kuivenen, and my wife Cindy. The experience of John King who is part of Final Command with discovery based training gave us reasonable confidence that this method of training would work.
\p This journey of discipleship for me started under the unseen guidance of the Holy Spirit, but took concrete form with a breakfast with Dave Hunt in San Jose, California thanks to the suggestion of David Cross who is a missionary with Pioneers. Dave was one of the key people working with City Team in East Africa involved with the amazing movement in Sub-Saharan Africa. It was Dave who visited our city and together with David Cross launched disciple making movements (DMM) in this part of the United States.
\p Richard Williams who has become both a good friend and my supervisor with City Team, spent hours teaching, coaching and mentoring me. He even sent me Ed Gross, during the difficulties of getting started with the first iDisciple training here. Ed’s series of talks on First Century Discipleship released an energy that made our first training the largest City Team had sponsored. My best trainer however, has been Ricardo Pineda, who introduced me to the deepest part of the Great Shamah in Deuteronomy 6. These three men together with Dave Hunt, continue to be my main support for all of the work that I have been able to do, both here in the United States and in the rest of the world.
\p Next in line are the two men that have provided me with the most inspiration and technical understanding about DMM. First, Jerry Trousdale, who ventured to come to our first training when it seemed questionable whether there would be enough people to have a seminar. Jerry’s experience and gentle compassion for seeing people becoming disciples of Jesus has been infectious in my life. Finally, is the man who God used to lay the foundational understanding of DMM in Northern India and to spread the message and training to all parts of the world, David Watson. I have been honored to get to know both of these men and to continue to receive input from them.
\p Two other men were responsible for breaking me out of the routine Christian life that I had been living for a decade. Graham Cooke and Bill Johnson opened up a different dimension to the Kingdom of God than I have ever seen before.
\p All of my discipleship experience is built upon a foundation of Christian community experience and teaching. I am indebted to Larry Alberts who was the first person that God used to disciple and form me. The teachings of Steve Clark and Ralph Martin established my understanding of community and the Christian Life. Ern Baxter, Charles Simpson, and Bob Mumford’s teachings challenged me all areas of my life. John Wimber’s teachings on healing taught me that the miraculous is the natural work of the Holy Spirit with whom we can actively participate. Finally there is Bill Gothard whose intense focus of the sufficiency of the Bible for all matters of life, planted roots in me that have found new life in discovery Bible studies.
\p So, I am greatly thankful to each of these people. If God uses the following pages in your life, then you can be grateful to them as well.

\periph Foreword
\ms2 Foreword
\p The goal of this book is to serve as a practical training-guide to help people engage in the process of being and making disciples. Discovering the truths about discipleship directly from the Bible is much more impactful than the finest teachings that anyone can give. For this reason the center of this training is a series of fifteen passages from the Bible that have been selected to present the key teachings of Jesus and his disciples about becoming and making other disciples.
\p This book will answer the question of, \bd “What does it mean to be a disciple of Jesus?”\bd* During forty years of listening to and participating in discussions about discipleship, it was not until I heard Ed Gross speaking about First Century Discipleship that I finally could say I knew what it means to be a disciple of Jesus. We will cite Ed’s book, \it Are you a Christian or a Disciple?\it* several times. Jerry Trousdale in his book \it Miraculous Movements,\it* and David and Paul Watson in their book, \it Contagious Disciple Making\it* relate their experiences in developing and applying the DMM process in India (Watson) and in Sub-Saharan Africa (Trousdale) with amazing testimonies and great practical wisdom.
\p The second question that will be answered is, “\bd What is required to make a disciple of Jesus and what is our role in that process?”\bd* This is the heart of the discovery process that you will learn to use. Fully understanding the discovery process will involve learning how to facilitate a discovery group yourself. This book will guide you in starting a disciple making discovery group. Reading this book will provide insights that will change the way you look at the world. However, you will need to form a small group of people and examine these passages, learn them by memory, apply them obediently to your own life, and share what you have learned with others to understand the discovery process. Only at this point will you begin to experience the full potential of becoming a disciple of Jesus who in turn is empowered to make other disciples.
\p The final goal of this study, is that you together with at least one other person, will fully implement the strategy that Jesus laid out by first becoming a disciple, then reaching out to invite believers to become disciples, who can reach not-yet believers in your community, and finally go wherever Jesus and his Holy Spirit direct you.
\p In order for this to be a complete resource for disciples who will make other disciples, there are six appendices which provide complete lists of discovery passages to use in discipling groups of people from an interest in God, to Jesus, then to becoming churches (2). There are helps for starting (5) and continuing (1) discipleship discovery groups, prayer resources (4), and additional online training resources (6).
\p I waited more than thirty years to experience what you are about to be introduced to. Two separate conversations with God began to prepare me for what I have been able to witness and experience. The first was when I was looking at world missions and challenged by Jesus’ final command, which we refer to as the Great Commission. The second was when I was confronted with a very difficult decision in my life. When I speak of conversations with God, I mean those times when I wrestle with questions that culminate in God ‘speaking’ to me that settles the issue.
\p The first conversation took place off-and-on over several weeks. I had been studying world missions in the light of fulfilling the Great Commission. The amount of money the church was spending on missions was and still is, less than 10% of their total income. The size of the job to accomplish the Great Commission could drain all of the coffers of all of the churches and still not be accomplished using the methods that we had been using. It did not occur to me to ask if there were other ways. I simply thought that it was impossible unless God intervened.
\p One day I cried out to God, “How can the Great Commission be fulfilled? What we are doing is not able to even keep up with the birth rate. Even if we spent all of the church’s money and efforts to send out missionaries, the way we are doing it, it is impossible to fulfill Jesus’ last command.” God ‘spoke’ to me and said, “When you see Asia and Africa sending missionaries into all of the world, then you will know that the Great Commission will be completed.” That settled it for me and I did not worry about it anymore. There was no promise that I would see it, but if I did, I would know that Jesus’ command would be fulfilled.
\p It was about 10 years later that I heard stories of Korea sending out missionaries. Ten years after that I heard that house churches in China were talking of sending out missionaries to other countries. I was excited, but what about Africa? Every time I ran across an article from Africa, the story was always about how much help the church in Africa needed; “help us, send us, give us.” After a while, I thought, “not in my lifetime would I see Africa sending out missionaries to complete the Great Commission.”
\p The second conversation occurred a few years later. I had to choose between two diverging groups. I had made a binding verbal commitment to the one group, but to the other I had a personal allegiance and shared vision. I was inclined to follow my commitment because I place a high value on keeping my word, but the Lord made it clear to me that I should go with other group. However, to choose this other way would not only mean breaking my word, but also be very painful for my wife and children. I bargained with the Lord and cried out saying that all I needed was to be able to worship and grow in knowledge of Him. God very clearly said to me in the midst of my emotional pain, “Jim if you stay with the group you have given your word to, you can love me, worship me and grow closer to me, but I cannot fulfill the call I have for your life.” Like Gideon, I put forth a fleece, “God”, I said, “If I am released and don’t have to break my word, without my asking, then I will know that you indeed have spoken and will choose this more difficult path.” God quickly answered that prayer. Yes, as I had thought, it was a very difficult time for me and my family. We lost many close friends.
\p The years after this were full and active. God used Cindy and me in many ways. Eventually thirty years later, I moved into a ministry as an evangelist, but I was frustrated, because of all the people that I prayed with to repent of their sins and ask Jesus into their lives, not one was interested in anything more. What was the matter? When I searched the gospels to see what Jesus had to say about evangelism, I found out that the word and concept was not part of anything that Jesus did or told us to do. He said “make disciples.” But, where were the instructions? Six months later I was introduced to Disciple Making Movements (DMM) at a Saturday “iDisciple awareness training” in San Jose, CA. From the time we first did a discovery study of Luke 10:1-11, I immediately saw that here were the instructions on how the disciples made disciples.
\p Jerry Trousdale’s book had just been released. Cindy read different parts for me as I was preparing to teach my course on evangelism. We both realized that making disciples was possible and that this was the way, and the only way that the Great Commission could be completed. What Jerry documented in Africa, moved it past theory by showing that hundreds of thousands of non-believers and especially Muslims, were becoming disciples of Jesus and leading others into the same relationship. Churches were springing up in some of most hostile places on the earth.
\p It was Cindy who suggested that we begin to pray that God would begin Disciple Making Movements in our own city and state. And we did indeed pray. Those prayers happened to match up with the prayer of David Cross with Pioneer Missions who gave us a few weeks of DMM training and invited Dave Hunt to meet with anyone that we could round up with a few days’ notice. Two dozen people attended that afternoon meeting, twenty of whom I did not know, nor did I know where they came from.
\p My qualifications to lead this initial training effort boiled down to availability and willingness. - Well in reality it wasn’t that I was willing, but that I was open to try to coordinate an iDisciple Basic Training when no one else was available. Why did God choose Cindy and me? It was probably because we asked God to start disciple making movements. I have learned that when God answers the prayer of a disciple, it frequently includes the active involvement of the person who prayed. – Please note for your future reference.
\p For the initial training, City Team was bringing four trainers and we had booked a room that would comfortably seat 60. However, a week before the training only a dozen people had registered. Like our initial meeting with Dave Hunt where many unexpected people showed up from unanticipated places, so the room was packed with more than 80 people in attendance. Now several trainings later and increased personal experience both with teaching many people and applying the discovery process to our own lives, we have become increasingly convinced that the Disciple Making Discovery Process can indeed change the course of history by making small groups of disciples of Jesus. I believe that Disciples Making Movements are capable of fulfilling the Great Commission in less than one lifetime.
\p The culmination of all of this occurred in December of 2013 when Cindy and I and our oldest granddaughter Natasha, went to Sierra Leone to see what was happening with disciple making movements in that nation. Sierra Leone’s Christian population over eight years had grown from less than 10% to about 30%. A significant part of this could be attributed to DMM. We wanted to see how discovery groups functioned as they matured. We had no idea that we were being invited to attend New Harvest Ministries’ biennial “Mega-Fest;” eight days of intense church planting strategy and tactics training. The theme of the conference was “To the Ends of the Earth.” It wasn’t until the end of the second day, that I realized that what I was hearing from speaker after speaker had a common theme. “We are deeply indebted to European and American missionaries and indeed we are poor, yet we have the two most important things we need to fulfill the Great Commission, we are disciples who have the word of God and we know how to make disciples. We are going first to North Africa, which is the most resistant place on the planet to the gospel, and then we are going to Europe and then to the ends of the earth.”
\p Suddenly the promise that God had made to me 35 years earlier came back to mind. We met Chinese missionaries in Africa later that trip, but I was hearing these 1500 church planters commit themselves to fulfilling the Great Commission. Oh, by the way more than 500 of these church planters came from Muslim backgrounds. So, what you are going to be introduced to has potential to release you into one of the most amazing adventures in God’s writing of history. This opportunity to introduce DMM to you is the plan I waited thirty years for God to bring me into.

\periph Introduction
\ms1 Introduction
\ms2 Disciple Making Movements
\p Discipleship will mean a new world to you as you become a disciple of Jesus. You will be transformed, so that everywhere you go, you will find yourself meeting people who God is touching with his Holy Spirit. You will lead some of these into a similar discipleship relationship with Jesus that you have. This is the power behind what is called “disciple making movements.”
\p What is a disciple? Is it possible to actually be a disciple of Jesus? Don’t we need a human agent to disciple us? These are important questions. The early implementers of disciple making movements started with one question that led to others, “What did Jesus tell us?” Next, they asked how could that apply to us today?
\p This book is intended to present what these men and women discovered and are applying around the world.
\q “\v 3 [Jesus’] divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence,… \v 5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge,\v 6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness,\v 7 and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.\v 8 For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ” \rq (2 Peter 1:3,5-8)\rq*.
\p In the above passage Jesus grants us access to all things pertaining to life and godliness. And Peter affirms some of the “disciplines” necessary to be effective disciples of Jesus.
\ms4 The church and the world
\p The church throughout the world is experiencing challenges that have never occurred from so many directions at once. Europe which two hundred years ago was the bastion of Christendom now has the least number of professing Christians of any continent in the world. Canada and the US are witnessing a decline of church membership and attendance that in the next 35 years will see the Church in America reduced to similar size of that of Europe.
\p In the Middle East hundreds of thousands of Christians are being driven from their homes, thousands are being killed. The times are violent and the violence comes closer every day. The forces of evil are being released from both within the church and without. It is obvious that “business as usual” will not reverse these trends. Something different is needed.
\p Certainly, these are alarming signs that don’t require great spiritual maturity or prophetic gifting to recognize. But God has not been caught off guard. He is doing something old, yet quite new. He is doing something that sounds familiar, but can make us uncomfortable. The Holy Spirit is restoring the call to make disciples of Jesus. He is equipping us to do this by very simple means. Everywhere where there is an attack of Satan, God is counterattacking with unstoppable force. He is neither committed to military force, nor political negotiations, nor media blitzes. These can only slow the moral decline and restore a shadow of the previous status quo.
\p God is doing something much greater and more powerful than anything that armies, politicians, or businesses can accomplish. He is teaching those who will listen, how to become and make disciples. Jesus’ last words in Matthew 28 were not meant as good advice leading to personal fulfillment or putting more people in pews on Sunday, but rather were designed to conquer Satan and win back the world for Jesus who is reconciling us to the Father.
\p This book is written for all those “who have obtained a faith of equal standing” (2 Peter 1:1) and have embarked or desire to embark, on the pursuit of being disciples of Jesus. It is for those who are willing to exercise the disciplines, so as to be able to make other disciples who also will follow Jesus. This is the Great Commission!
\p In this time of radical change and rapid decline of the Christian Church in the United States and the collapse of the Church in Europe, in this time of physical attack upon the church in many parts of the world, there are nevertheless some exciting things happening as we look around us. The numbers of evangelical-believing Christians is estimated at 180 million in Africa, 150 million in Asia, 120 million in South America, while North America is credited with 100 million and Europe with 6 million.
\p In 1949 when Mao Zedong came to power in China and expelled all of the foreign missionaries, there was a great lamentation in the West that this marked the end of Christianity in China. God surprised us all. Today China has produced a church that numbers between 60 and 120 million and is sending out missionaries to other lands.
\p India, which had been almost impervious to the spread of gospel, maintaining about 2% Christian population from 1950 until 2005 according to one mission group, has almost tripled and is now about 7% of the second largest and fastest growing population in the world. One 25 year-old movement in India headed by Victor Choudhrie, baptized over 1 million new believers in 2012. Victor Johns heads another 30 year-old movement of more than 100,000 indigenous churches and 6 million believers in one of the most resistant areas in the country. Joy Punnoose heads a group of tens of thousands of new believers and church planters in another difficult area. There are many other smaller works as well.
\p As mentioned earlier there are now more evangelical Christians in Africa than any other continent. We will learn further on about the hundreds of thousands of Muslims who have become followers and disciples of Jesus across Africa. Thousands of them are now making disciples and working to plant churches in some of the most hostile areas of Africa.
\p So, what is the secret to this rapid growth? One thing it is not, it is not the application of western missionary or evangelism methods. That is not to say that early western missionaries have not laid an essential foundation, but that the rapid expansion is something entirely different.
\p How does this work and what is the secret to their success and growth? If we discover it and apply it, will it have similar effects in this county? We have discovered it! It is found in the pages of the four gospels. It was there all along. The amazing growth has come because normal believers simply decided to obey and do what the gospels tell us. They have started doing what eleven men who followed Jesus did. When Jesus said to his disciples “Having gone, make disciples . . .” they went and made disciples. That is what they did, and Jesus built his church, which is why you and I profess Jesus as our Lord today.
\p Will it work in the United States and in cities of the world? There are areas where we are already seeing some initial success, but there are many questions that remain. This is the point where you and I can enter into an adventure. My hope is that your life will be profoundly changed and that your relationship with Jesus will deepen. As you enter into the discipleship process, your vision and ability to fulfill Jesus' final command will increase. My life and the lives of thousands of people who are becoming disciples of Jesus give testimony of the transformation and deepening relationship with Jesus that comes from moving from being a believer and follower of Jesus to being his disciple.
\ms4 What are Disciple Making Movements (DMM)?
\p David Watson has defined DMM as:
\p “\it a methodology for starting Church Planting Movements. It focuses on developing self-replicating leaders who make self-replicating disciple makers.\it*
\p “\it Disciples and potential disciples are trained in a simple inductive Bible study called a Discovery Bible Study and in an evangelism process called a Discovery Group. This allows them to learn on their own what the Bible says, encourages them to obey the Bible and to share what they learn with others around them. They are also encouraged to engage in meeting the needs within their groups and communities.\it*
\p “\it In situations where there are no disciples or potential disciples, leaders are trained to look for Persons of Peace, those God has prepared to receive the Gospel, and then begin this process with them.\it*
\p “\it The strategy for DMM is found in Matthew 28:16-20. The tactics for DMM are found in numerous verses, including Luke 10, Luke 9, Matthew 10, Mark 6, Deuteronomy 6, John 6, John 14 and John 15.\it*
\p “\it All success points in DMM are defined by reproduction. Without reproduction there is no success. Leaders must reproduce leaders. Disciples reproduce disciples. Discovery groups reproduce discovery groups. And, churches reproduce churches.”\it* (David Watson in an email to Kurt Olson, December 18, 2014.)
\p We will start by presenting an overview of DMM and the framework in which it operates. I hope that it will make clear to you the need to make disciples rather than converts, nominal Christians, or even believers in Jesus. My first goal is that each reader and practitioner would become a disciple of Jesus. Making other disciples follows naturally from this first step.
\p The core of the application of this Jesus-focused discipleship is the “Discovery Process.” It is a very simple five step process, designed to be replicable, multiplying, and produce spiritual growth in the participants. The intention is that each disciple will learn to work with Jesus to make other disciples.
\p To begin, you might have to “unlearn” some of what you have incorporated into your current Christian life. We will take a look at what Jesus said about many things. I know that in my initial encounter with scripture and obedience based discipleship to Jesus, there were things that I struggled with, even after I saw them in Jesus’ words and actions in the Bible. Hopefully, this book will lay a framework that will help you reconcile the way you have always thought, to this Jesus focused discipleship, that we will see in the Bible.
\p One of the first things to start our journey is the reality, that if Jesus is to be your Rabbi; if you are to be his disciple, then his teachings and words are the center of everything that you study, seek to understand, and believe. Not all of the Bible is a level playing field to a disciple of Jesus. Jesus’ words are paramount. All scripture is interpreted by Jesus’ words. What did Jesus have to say about the Old Testament law and stories? How do the epistles apply and reflect what Jesus taught?
\p I will frequently refer to three books which are important for you to read for background information. The first, \it Miraculous Movements,\it* by Jerry Trousdale documents the impact that DMM has had in Africa from 2005 until 2012 using a combination of testimonies, commentary and explanation. More than one person has described it as like reading another chapter in the book of Acts of the Apostles.
\p The second, \it Are you a Christian or a Disciple?\it* by Edward Gross lays out a theological framework for discipleship. Dr. Gross’ focus has been on first century discipleship. Understanding what the Bible meant by the word “disciple” is helpful in understanding what the discipleship process that is presented here is all about.
\p The last of the three books \it Contagious Disciple Making,\it* by David Watson and his son Paul, gives the thoughts of the man who God used to launch DMM in the late 1980s. David and his son are international leaders as well as practitioners and trainers. David introduced DMM around the world. Practitioners of discipleship and evangelism ministries find that the Watsons’ insights and advice have given them understanding that they have been seeking.
\p This concludes the introduction. The next section will begin guiding you in the discovery process. It is the study guide.

\ms4 Discovery Discipleship Bible Studies
\p This book is designed to supplement small group discovery studies of fifteen different passages. Discovery studies are small group inductive studies that include the additional components of memorizing the passages, applying them in practical ways to our lives, and telling other people about the passage that we have learned. It is these three additional steps that turn the inductive study into a disciple making process.
\p The ideal group size is four to eight people. As a minimum you will need one other person to join you. For a group of six people plan to spend one and one-half hours together. The meeting times will follow the format laid out in Appendix 5 and explained in the next two chapters.
\p Following is the list of passages, supporting chapters in this book, and training videos that you can download and use.

\periph Chapter 1. Context of DMM
\ms1 Chapter 1
\ms2 Context of DMM
\ms4 Kingdom is Encompassing:
\p The Kingdom is the central message of the gospel. John the Baptist came proclaiming “repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.” After he was arrested (Mark 1:14-15), Jesus took up the same proclamation.
\p Jesus did not come proclaiming salvation, Christianity, the church and certainly not prosperity and happiness. He followed John the Baptist’s message, “Repent for the Kingdom of God, or the Kingdom of Heaven, is near, or at hand.” This is the central truth of Jesus’ message. The kingdom is bigger than any of these, including salvation, the church, and true prosperity and happiness, which fit within it.

\pc Figure 1.1 – Kingdom Circles \it (adapted from Common Ground Consultants)\it* \b0
\p A kingdom has certain characteristics. It has a king, citizens, constitution and nature, and it has laws and rules. Jesus made it clear at the outset that you do not have to become a Jew to be in the kingdom. (Luke 2:9-10; 4:25-28 – Jesus’ ministry reached beyond the Jews from the beginning).
\p \bd Repentance:\bd* It is necessary to repent or change the direction of your life, to enter the kingdom. That means that your priorities, desires, actions, and thoughts need to line up with the Kingdom’s. The Greek word for repentance “Metanoia” (μετάνοια) literally means a change of mind or nature. “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,” (Romans 12:2a) Repentance in this sense, means much more than being sorry for, or merely avoiding things that are grossly bad or evil. It means a realignment of your life in every area to conform to the Word of God.
\p This definition of repentance describes much of what it means to be obedient as a disciple. Biblical discipleship is ongoing transformational repentance which prepares disciples to enter and participate in the Kingdom of God. It is implemented by responding to the things the Holy Spirit reveals in the group discovery of passages of the Bible, with “I will” and “we will” statements that produce a change in the way we relate to the world.
\ms4 Family is Foundational:
\p Discipleship is not organizational. To be a disciple is to be part of a family. Our Father in heaven works through his son Jesus and his Holy Spirit. God’s identity itself is in family (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). Everything about discipleship and the kingdom is relational. We love one another, care for one another, correct one another, help one another, and learn from one another. We are family but we are directed by one teacher and one Lord, Jesus.
\p As disciples, our identity is in God’s family. (We are children of God, brothers and sisters.) We must learn to live our lives openly before one-another. That means we talk to each other, confessing our sins, sharing our joys, our sorrows, and our difficulties. Like members of a family, we need to learn to handle conflicts and direct confrontation without becoming so offended that we break off relationships. Jesus was very blunt with people including his disciples. Having a “teachable” spirit means that a disciple will seek to learn from every encounter, especially when it would be easy to take offense at either the message or the method of delivery. (Ephesians 4:13-15)
\ms4 Discipleship is focused on Jesus
\p Being a disciple means doing \bd what\bd* Jesus taught us to do and the\bd way\bd* that he told us to do it. Since the entire record that we have of Jesus is contained in the words of the Bible, we are going to focus on learning and internalizing the words of the stories of the Bible. As Jesus said “The one who loves me is he who makes my commandments his own and obeys them.” (John 14:21)
\p Practically this means that we start where Jesus started. Jesus worked with men who were well grounded in all of the Old Testament. Knowledge of the Old Testament forms the foundation upon which we build our understanding as disciples. Internalizing these stories connects us to Jesus’ heart and those of his disciples. As much as possible, we want to make them part of us, to engrave them on our hearts.
\p Once we have laid in a solid scriptural foundation of the Old Testament, the four Gospels become the center and core of discipleship. Jesus worked diligently to challenge his disciples to draw close to God until finally, as we see with Simon Peter in Matthew 16:15-18. They learned to hear directly from God the Father. Only in the gospels do we find this orientation.
\p Did the Apostles make disciples of Jesus or disciples of themselves? Being a disciple of Jesus is gospel centered. If you look you will find that the word “disciple” does not appear in the Bible after the book of the Acts of the Apostles. Does that mean that the Apostles did not make disciples of Jesus? Did they ignore the “Great Commission of Jesus?” We tend to separate the epistles from the Gospels and forget that the four gospels also represent the apostolic teachings of Matthew, Peter (Gospel according to Mark), Paul (Gospel according to Luke), and John.
\p Discipleship revolves around the gospels. If we accept the four gospels as examples of the discipleship training used in the early church, then we will see this clearly in the Apostles’ teaching. The main teaching in the epistles is derived from the Apostles’ understanding of what they observed or learned as disciples of Jesus. Their gospel accounts and disciple training was foundational, but distinct from the work that they did with church formation. We will see later that this conforms to Jesus’ own instructions on the matter of making disciples (Matthew 23:8-12).
\p The Epistles are founded upon the teachings of Jesus, but are centered on church formation. They are supplemental to the Gospels for discipleship. By this latter statement, I mean for example that Paul particularly took effort to clarify gospel truths when people misunderstood or misapplied the gospels. For example Paul highlights Jesus teaching that “no one comes to the Father except through me,” by saying that “by grace you have been saved through faith.” (John 14:6 and Ephesians 2:8). The teaching Paul used to teach people about being disciples, is probably similar to that in the gospel of Luke. Peter’s discipleship training materials probably were similar to the gospel of Mark.
\p The writers of the epistles were establishing and supporting all of the necessary functions of the church, including government and culture. What the “Law” did for the Hebrew people, the epistles are doing for the church.
\p The Law – The Torah – had at least three functions. Its main focus was to provide a means of being reconciled to God and define our relationship with Him. The second function was to establish basic moral guidance. The third function of the Law was to define a unique people; to set a group apart and give them a coherent identity and governance. The Epistles serve the latter two functions for the church.
\p Jesus replaced the first function of the Law because he has become the new Adam who reconciles us to his father through himself (John 14:19-20). There is no need of ritual sacrifice and ceremonies. The veil separating mankind from God has been broken. Jesus is the eternal, heavenly, Holy of Holies. We abide in Jesus and he abides in us and so we have full entrance to the presence of God as adopted sons and daughters. Being a disciple of Jesus brings us more deeply into this reality.
\p The driving question for the development of the discovery discipleship process is, how can we replicate Jesus’ discipleship process? More than twenty years of experience demonstrates that the discovery group process which will be described in Chapters 3 and 4, replicates very closely how Jesus taught his disciples.
\b
\ms4 History of DMM
\p While the history of “disciple making movements” (DMM), dates only from about 1989, the original process that Jesus used was implemented by the eleven men that Jesus sent out from a hillside in Galilee, plus the extra one disciple of Gamaliel that Jesus “picked up” on the road to Damascus. These twelve men successfully made disciples without external logistical support, Bible colleges and seminaries. Within two years all of the residents of Asia (estimated at 15 million people) had at least heard the words of the gospel (Acts 19:10). And the hundreds of millions of followers of Jesus today are living proof that the process worked.
\p Discipleship has a cost to consider when embarking on the journey with Jesus. For the disciples, their amazing success cost all of them much affliction, deprivations, and suffering. In the end it cost all, but one of the disciples their lives. And John, who died a natural death, lived the last several years in exile separated from the people he loved. What was so precious to these men that they felt their suffering was a price worth paying?
\p The original eleven were simple, unlearned, unpolished men, although the disciples Jesus met along the road to Damascus was highly educated. From this we learn at least a couple of important things. First, the discipleship process must be simple enough to learn and use, that even unpolished and uneducated people can be taught and use it. Second, it must be rich enough so that brilliant and highly educated people can find a framework to grow in knowledge and understanding of God.
\p Developing the modern DMM process as described by David Watson, was one of questioning everything previously done with contemporary missions and comparing it to what Jesus actually did, as best as possible. If something was compatible with what Jesus did you will find it in the DMM process. This means that there are some techniques and similar orientations that you can find in all successful mission organizations and ministries such as Navigators and Evangelism Explosion.
\p It is not that DMM is completely different, but there are some fundamental differences that separate it from almost all other evangelism or mission techniques. Particularly the concept that people can actually become disciples of Jesus by direct discipleship to the Bible is fundamentally different. The role of the disciple maker as a “brother” rather than a teacher is also radically difference. There are several other significant difference that we will look at a little later.
\p What is attractive to mission agencies who are adapting this approach? Usually it is the simplicity of the process, the focus on families and natural social groups and the mentoring of those who are not yet believers to invite others into the discovery process. This results in rapid multiplication and a focus on the scriptures which leads to fidelity to the Bible. These things are what these organizations find attractive and energizing.
\p DMM as we practice it was developed in India in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Following are some excerpts from an article written by David Watson, who was one of the key people in its development and the introduction of DMM around the world.
\ms4 History in India
\p Excerpts from \it Perspectives on the World Christian Movement\it*: “A Movement of God Among the Bhojpuri of North India,” David Watson writes:
\p “\it None of us, in our wildest dreams, ever thought we would witness what was happening. We had no plans for seeing hundreds and thousands of churches started. We didn’t think it was possible in the places we were trying reach, for they had demonstrated great resistance to the gospel. We were doing everything we could think of in hopes that something would get started.\it*
\p \it Six men that I had worked with had been martyred over the last 18 months. The Indian government expelled our family from the country. There were 80 million Bhojpuri living in an area known as “the graveyard of missions and missionaries.” There were only 27 evangelical churches in the area. They struggled to survive. Less than 1000 believers lived among the Bhojpuri at that time. . . .\it*
\p \it [I told God] I cannot believe that you [God] would call someone to do a task without telling them how to do it. Show me in your word, how you want me to reach those people. If you show me, “I will” do it.\it*
\p \it This was my covenant with God. God upheld his part. Over the next year, he led me through scripture and brought my attention to things I had read, but never understood – at least in this context. Patterns emerged and new thoughts about church, making disciples and church planting came to life.\it*
\p \it I prayed for five Indian men to help develop these ideas in North India. I met the first one at a secret forum gathered in India to discuss evangelizing Hindu peoples. His name was Victor John. . . .\it*
\p “\it I believe what you’re saying,” he told me. “I can see it too.” Over the next year three other men emerged to work with me. [Finally] I got a letter from someone I didn’t know in India.\it*
\p “\it Brother David,” it began, “You don’t know me, but I feel God telling me that I should become your disciple.” But God didn’t give me the man I prayer for. You see, a woman wrote the letter I got that day.\it*
\p \it Over the next few years we struggled as we implemented the things God taught us. Our first church planted with this new methodology, didn’t happen until two years after I met Victor.\it*
\p \it All of a sudden, we saw eight churches planted in one year. The next year, there were 48 new churches planted; the year after that, 148 new churches; then 327; and then 500. In the fifth year, we saw more than 1000 new churches planted!\it*
\p \it A formal survey of the work among the Bhojpuri showed that our team actually under-reported the number of churches planted in the area! Things were exploding and are still exploding?\it*
\p \it A couple of years ago I sat down with Victor John [One of David’s coworkers in India], “I am a millionaire,” he said\it*
\p \it What do you mean?\it*
\p \it He grinned, “This year, we baptized the one millionth Bhojpuri into the Kingdom. In God’s economy, that makes me a millionaire.”\it*
\p \it I couldn’t stop the tears - Over one million new brothers and sisters over 12 years – over 40,000 new churches.\it*
\p \it I had no idea that people would look back on what God did with my failure and call it a “movement.” I never dreamed he would make me a millionaire.”\it*

\ms4 Summary:
\p In 1990 David Watson working with five others searched scriptures and tried to build a church planting model based on Jesus’ life and teachings in the Gospels adapted to local culture
\p \bd Lesson:\bd* De-culture Western Christianity, start where Jesus started by making disciples
\p Took two years to plant first church: 8 churches  48 churches  148 churches  327 churches  500 churches  &gt;1000 churches.
\p \bd Lesson:\bd* go slow to grow fast
\ms4 David Watson’s “Critical” components
\p When David met with Bhojpuri leaders who were planting at least 50 churches a year, here is what he discovered among these most effective team leaders:
\li \bd Persistent Prayer\bd*: average 3 hours of \em personal\em* prayer a day, 3 hours of \em team\em* prayer a day, personal \em fasting\em* one day a week, and team fasting and prayer one weekend a month.
\p “\it Many of these leaders maintained secular jobs while engaged in their church planting. The got up to pray at 4 A.M. and were at work by 10 A.M.”\it*
\li \bd Obedience-Based Discipleship:\bd* \em Do\em* what the Bible says – \em share\em* what the Bible says with others. Hold each other accountable in the \em context of community\em*
\p “\it We teach every church planter and every believer in our ministry something very simple: If the Bible says “Do it,” then you must do it. It the Bible says “Don’t do it,” then you don’t do it. We also tell them they must pass everything they learn to someone else as soon as possible – the same day if the can. This cycle of hearing, obeying and sharing develops mature believers and fuels the movement among the Bhojpuri.\it*
\b
\p \it We noticed an interesting side effect of obedience-based discipleship. In most Bhojpuri churches, members from the highest to the lowest castes worship together.\it*
\b
\p \it You cannot have a movement if you do not obey God’s word.”\it*
\b
\li \bd Person of Peace:\bd* God is preparing people to come to him, our job is to \em find that person\em* and let the words of the Bible and the Holy Spirit speak to him.
\p “\it An old man sat on the edge of the road approaching the village. When he saw me, he seemed startled. He slowly stood up and came to meet me.\it*
\p “\it Finally!” He exclaimed. “You are finally here.” Before I could say anything he took my arm and pulled me into the village.\it*
\p “\it Here is the man I told you about. Here is the man I dreamed about every night for the last 20 years. My dreams told me that we must listen to everything this man tells us.\it*
\p “\it Bhojpuri church planters look for persons of peace – people God prepares to receive the gospel – every time they enter a village (Luke 10.) When they find the person of peace, the church planters build a relationship with the family and eventually go to their home and start a Discovery Bible Study\it*.”

\ms4 History in Sub-Saharan Africa
\p One of the important questions to ask about any methodology is, will it cross cultures? Is it portable to other cultures, nations, languages, and peoples?
\p Even as the one millionth Hindu background believer was being baptized in India a bold experiment was about to commence in Sub-Saharan Africa. Jerry Trousdale wrote,
\p “\it If we bring people to the scriptures from Muslim and Animist background, will they too become disciples of Jesus, who make other disciples and facilitate the growth of churches?” – (Miraculous Movements)\it*
\p Serious efforts to reach Muslims had been underway for many years, starting with prayer and engagement ministries. Literally hundreds of groups and organizations had been involved in these efforts, sometimes cooperating and other times in competition.
\p In 2003 one organization working in West Africa – “Final Command Ministries” was founded by Jerry Trousdale working together initially with Shedanke Johnson of New Harvest Ministries in Sierra Leone and eventually with several other indigenous leaders and organizations (mostly Muslim background believers) in other West Africa nations. In March of 2005 they joined with David Watson of City Team. Eight months later this work in West Africa was joined by a City Team work in Ethiopia which was under the leadership of Dave Hunt. The East Africa partnership eventually included more than five nations with 50 indigenous leaders and organizations. Jerry served as the initial overall director of the work in Africa under Harry Brown’s leadership. As the work progressed Younoussa Djao became the continental director of the entire work. By the end of 2014, the number of new believers exceeded one million – nine years after starting.

\p The story of the results of this collaboration over the seven years ending in 2012 is told in the book, \it Miraculous Movements,\it* by Jerry Trousdale.
\p The stories in \it Miraculous Movements\it* and the companion book \it Father Glorified,\it* by Pat Robertson, are so amazing that not a few people have asked me if they are true. My wife Cindy and I visited Sierra Leone in 2014 and can personally attest to having seen at least three of the people mentioned in the book. They are key workers in disciple making movements in Sierra Leone that have resulted in hundreds of new churches: the blind man, the man who met the imam under the tree and the illiterate woman. These two books are amazing and encouraging. As Jerry Trousdale writes:
\p “\it CityTeam and our partner organizations are seeing changes as increasing numbers of churches are being planted among Muslims in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, but our longest and deepest involvement with Islamic regions has been in Africa. Therefore, over the last seven years, for us and for a few hundred African ministries with whom we partner, the changes among African Muslim peoples as resulted in the following:\it*
\li \it More than six thousand new churches have been planted among Muslims in eighteen different countries;\it*
\li \it Hundreds of former sheikhs and imams, now Christ followers, are boldly leading great movements of Muslims out of Islam;\it*
\li \it Forty-five different unreached Muslim-majority people groups, who a few years ago had no access to God’s Word, now have more than three thousand new churches among them;\it*
\li \it Thousands of former Muslims are experiencing the loss of possessions, homes, and loved ones, but they are continuing to serve Jesus;\it*
\li \it Multiple Muslim communities, seeing the dramatic changes in nearby communities, are insisting that someone must bring these changes to their community also; and\it*
\li \it More than 350 different ministries are working together to achieve these outcomes. . . . In recent years, we have concluded that “disciple making” is a more accurate term than “church planting” to describe the core biblical principles at work in these rapidly multiplying movements.\it*
\p (\it Miraculous Movement,\it* pp. 15-16 by Jerry Trousdale)
\b
\p In a nutshell, Disciple Making Movements spread the gospel by making disciples who learn to obey the Word of God and quickly make other disciples, who then repeat the process. All the principles that we are seeing at work are clearly outlined – indeed, commanded – in the pages of Scripture.”
\ms4 History of DMM around the world
\p When people speak of church planting or disciple making movements, it may be defined as follows: “A movement is a series of replicating groups or churches that consist of over 1000 people, or 100 hundred churches or home groups that have reproduced to at least 4 generations.”
\p Subsequent to the work in India, Africa, and Indonesia, which has not been described here, which today are each estimated to have produced more than a million believers, smaller movements are occurring in California, USA in 2007 with more than10,000 in Christ today, Nicaragua and Honduras in 2010 with more than 5,000 disciples of Jesus today. There are rapidly growing disciple making groups in Haiti, Mexico, and Jamaica, each of which will probably have become official movements before the end of 2015.

\b0
\p The Latin American communities were all spawned from the California movement. The one group that started in San Jose in 2007 has produced tens of thousands of new believing disciples of Jesus. There is also a nascent movement that originated in the Philadelphia, New Jersey areas that has exceeded 40 groups and is comprised of homeless people living on the streets and in the shelters of more than five cities in three different states.
\ms4 God’s Church in China
\p The largest of all movements has been occurring in China for more than 40 years, where it is estimated that more than 30,000 new believers are added every day. The number of believers in underground home churches is believed to number millions with the usual range given as between 60 million and 120 million.
\p All of the movements in China share a common commitment to obeying and telling the Word of God. While the focus is usually on planting churches, there is an increasing emphasis on making disciples who can and do make disciples.
\p While the rapid expansion in numbers is what usually grabs people’s attention, there is an equally important growth going on within disciple making movements. The reading, memorizing, discussing, practical application, and telling of the words in the Bible has the ability to produce deep spiritual growth and spiritually mature believers and disciples of Jesus.
\ms4 What about the Church in North America?
\p In John S. Dickerson’s 2013 book, \it The Great Evangelical Recession,\it* he looks at the current demographical trends and outlines a bleak future for the Christian churches in America. Some of the major themes include rapidly increasing social hostility, internal political divisions, declining financial giving, the abandonment of the church by the young adults, and the loss of membership with the passing of the older generation.*The illusion presented by the rapid increase in size and numbers of “mega-churches” covers up the rapid decline in overall church membership and decrease in the overall number of churches.
\p When Dickerson looks at the fact that about 70% of youth raised in the church are abandoning it by the time they are 30, he sums up this part of the puzzle:
\p “\it . . .we are failing at discipleship. That is, we are failing at the core command Jesus gave to His followers.” Paraphrasing Jeff Schadt,. . “ many parents rely too heavily on the church to do discipleship.”\it*
\p Many churches have failed at discipleship not only for lack of trying, but because they do not know what being a disciple of Jesus means. We don’t know what a disciple is because we ourselves have not been disciples in the sense that those who followed Jesus were disciples.
\p This book, will guide you to discover and apply some of the basic concepts necessary to become a disciple of Jesus similar to those used by Jesus and the twelve original disciples. My hope is first to see those who faithfully attend church, become disciples of Jesus through obedient application of the words of the Bible to their lives. Next, I hope to see that these people would aspire to raise their children as disciples of Jesus through the same process. Finally, it is my hope that they would begin making disciples of their neighbors, friends, and extended family members. This is what has been happening in the places that have seen these rapidly reproducing disciple making movements around the world.
\p What is so different about Disciple Making Movements that produces such amazing results? The Church of the West has been expending great efforts at missions since the 19th Century without seeing anything comparable to this. We have had prayer efforts, we have sent missionaries and we have translated the Bible into thousands of languages. Yet until these movements began there were only six identified “movements” among resistant peoples until 1950 and now there are more than 100.
\p Much of this book is focused on explaining the processes that make it all possible, but there are some significant philosophical differences between DMM and the evangelism approach that has been the primary method used up to this time. To understand DMM requires significant shifts in our paradigms.
\p Take a few minutes to read and reflect on these two following comparative lists. Many of my own challenges in initially understanding and accepting DMM were in failing to recognize that DMM is not just another method of evangelism. These two processes have different goals. DMM should explicitly result in disciples of Jesus, not merely converts and it should result in the planting of new churches, not in increased church membership .

\p Evangelism is an integral part of Disciple Making Movements, but embracing obedience based discipleship requires expanding our vision and understanding to accommodate a much larger goal, the fulfillment of the Great Commission.
\p Shifting our understanding of “Salvation” from simply forgiveness of people’s sins to the concept of entering into the Kingdom of God will add greater depth to our expectations. Paul summarized this in Colossians 1:13-14:
\q "He has delivered \it[saved]\it* us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
\p \it saved\it* - my editorial addition
\p Transitioning our vision from saving an “individual” to bringing salvation to households will allow us to see more of the “harvest fields.”
\iq1 \bd Acts 16:30-32\bd* Then he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”\v 31 And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\v 32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
\p Understanding that saving belief grows out of a relationship of obedience to Jesus as Lord, and that this is one of the critical disciplines of a disciple will give you an understanding of discipling people to Jesus.
\iq1 \bd Romans 10:9\bd* “because, if you confess with your mouth that \em Jesus is Lord\em* and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”
\p Taking a few moments to consider that God had a purpose for starting at the beginning in revealing his plan and purpose incrementally to mankind. Also reflect that the Old Testament provides the foundation that Jesus built upon. This will begin to open your understanding to the importance of beginning at the beginning:
\iq1 \bd Genesis 1:1\bd* “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”
\p Why “facilitation” in place of “preaching and teaching?” Is “facilitation” Biblical? These are two important questions. The goal of Disciple Making Movements is to complete the Great Commission. The first assignment of a “disciple” of Jesus is to make disciples. How can a new disciple make disciples? It is possible by faithfully reading the scriptures in the Bible and allowing the Holy Spirit to do the teaching. This requires someone to facilitate. Facilitation is a skill easily learned that relies completely on the Holy Spirit and the words of the Bible to do the teaching.
\iq1 \bd Matthew 28:19a\bd* Go therefore and make disciples of all nations. . .
\iq1 \bd John 14:26\bd* But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.
\iq1 \bd Matthew 23:8\bd* But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.
\iq1 \bd Matthew 18:20\bd* For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.
\p “Discovery” of truth in the words of the Bible is by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, who Jesus promised will teach us and make us remember all of his words that we have committed to memory. There is no greater “persuasion” than having the Holy Spirit speak to a person personally.
\p “Disciples” not converts, why? Flipping the question, why did we ever settle on making converts when, as we have just read in Matthew 28:19, Jesus told us to make disciples?
\p Disciple making movements are about fulfilling the Great Commission. Jesus said that he would build his church once he has prepared a foundation of disciples. It is this purpose that drives everything about disciple making movements.
\iq \bd Matthew 16:18\bd* And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
\p DMM is not theory. There are the millions of people from all sorts of religious backgrounds who are living as disciples of Jesus and making other disciples. There are disciple making movements in many parts of the world that are continuing to replicate by making new disciples and seeing new churches grow. Obedience Based Discipleship is another tool for an evangelist, but one with a different purpose; the accomplishing of the Great Commission by making disciples of all nations.
\p Roy Moran, who developed the prototype of this two column chart we are looking at, points out that the cost of each baptized convert using traditional evangelism and western missionary methods is $720,000. The cost of a baptized disciple using the DMM model is $0.66. The sheer economics of fulfilling the Great Commission does not leave any other viable option.

\periph Chapter 2. Becoming a Disciple of Jesus
\ms1 Chapter 2
\ms2 Becoming a Disciple of Jesus
\p The goal which motivates this book is that you will put into practice what you learn and be equipped with information, training and experience to begin completing part of the Great Commission.
\p The process of bringing people to become disciples of Jesus starts with Genesis. The culmination of the process uses the four accounts of the gospel. The process is designed to develop a deep relationship between disciple and Jesus.
\p This process relies on several things. First, that if we seek to “discover” the truths of God in the Bible, the Holy Spirit will be faithful to teach us all things and bring all things [that we have memorized] to mind.”
\p Second, the process must be simple enough that anyone can do it with very little if any specialized training.
\p Third, that people will remain focused on what is in the Bible and not introduce outside materials.
\p Fourth, everyone engaged in the process is equal in becoming a disciple of Jesus; that is, the Bible through the Holy Spirit is the teacher, not a leader, pastor, or the participants. That translates into “no teaching or preaching” allowed when a group is engaging the scriptures in the disciple making process.
\p As we go along in this study you will be challenged to discover for yourself what God wants to teach you in the Bible. There will be many times that you will be left with a question which you will have to resolve in a dialogue with God. I call these “good questions.” They are the type of questions you find that Jesus led his disciples into and left them to resolve with God. When God gives you an answer to these questions, you will find that you are changed in a way that will change the world around you. When we study Matthew 16 we will see an example of this.
\p While you can read this book on your own, to put it into practice will require you to gather a small group of like-minded people. Look for people who have an interest in becoming disciples of Jesus and are willing to try to memorize, actually obey and share what they are learning with others. Invite them to one meeting. Watch the 8 minute video by Act Beyond (see appendix 6) and do a discovery study of Luke 10:1-11 then ask them if they would like to meet again.
\ms4 Start with Prayer
\p The backbone and the foundation of everything a disciple does is prayer. It would be a poor foundation to the process of discipleship if it is anything else but prayer.
\p First ask God to identify what group or groups of people he wants you to reach. This can be any group. For example it might be the neighbors around your church or your home, coworkers or fellow students, an ethnic groups of people in your city, students at a school or university, family or church members, or activity groups or clubs, such as: bridge, skateboarders, or bowling league. There is no limit to the harvest fields that are in need of workers. In a notebook, on one of the first lines write the names of one or more groups for whom God is giving you a heart and desire to reach. (see Figure 2.1)
\b
\tr \thc1 Group \thc2 Group \thc3 Group

\tr \tc1 Name \tc2 \tc3
\tr \tc1 \tc2 \tc3
\tr \tc1 \tc2 \tc3
\b
\pc Figure: 2.1 - Prayer grid to put in your notebook.
\p Next, think of people who may share an interest in reaching any of these groups that you can invite to participate with you in the process of making disciples. They could be people inside or outside the group you want to reach. Write their names in a list beneath each of the people groups. Take time in prayer to ask God to direct you as to how and when you should invite them to join you.
\p Jesus promises us to be with us whenever two or three are gathered in his name. (Matthew 18:20) The discipleship process is empowered when Jesus is with us. This group of fellow disciples will become intercessors and active participants to join you in making disciples among the lost.
\ms4 Transformed Lives
\p One of the pitfalls that people fall into when they first grasp and begin to apply disciple making principles, is to see these principles as a new set of tools to be integrate into their existing work. However, the tool that Jesus most easily uses is a transformed life of men and women who become his disciples.
\p The usual approach to presenting the Great Commission is to look only at Matthew 28:18-20, but this is not where the story starts and it misses some important components. Let’s start two verses earlier and see what we have been missing:
\iq1 \bd Matthew 28:16-20\bd* \v 16 Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. \v 17 And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. \v 18 And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. \v 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, \v 20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.
\p In verse 16 take time to answer two questions, “Who went? ”Why did they go?
\p _____________________________
\p _____________________________
\p So, then to whom are the command and directions in verses 18 through 20 given, everyone, believers, followers, or disciples? _______________________.
\p What then can we infer about the type of relationship with Jesus is necessary for us to be able to fulfill the Great Commission?
\p ____________________________________________________________________.
\p In verse 17 what was the response of the eleven? __________________________
\p How many doubted? _________________________________
\p What do we learn about the interaction of obedience, doubting, and being disciples from this passage?
\p ____________________________________________________________________
\p What possible things can we learn from Jesus’ response in verse 18 to the eleven’s action of obedience, worship yet doubting?
\p __________________________________________________________________________________________________
\p In verse 19, it usual to translate the past aorist participle Greek verb (πορευθέντες - poreuthentes) as a command “go” making a separate command from “make disciples.” In the Greek, the participle is literally “having gone.” While there is a strong connection with the two verbs, the fact is that there is only one command “make disciples” in this sentence. Translating the passage as “Therefore having gone, or \em as you go\em*, make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” will lead to different actions.
\p What would be different about how you implement verse 19 if you understand it to be one command instead of two commands?
\p ___________________________________________________________________________________________________
\p In verse 19, who is to baptize new disciples? _________________________
\p In verse 20, the Greek word translated “observe” is “Τηρεῖν” (terein) which means to continue to obey orders or commands, to obey, or to be keeping commandments. So, what are we to teach new disciples? ______________________
\p In practical terms, how does teaching disciples \em to obey\em* all that Jesus commanded differ from just teaching \em what\em* he commanded?
\p ________________________________________________________________
\p Jesus makes a promise in verse 20, what is it?
\p _________________________________________________________________
\p How might you experience the fulfillment of this promise?
\p ____________________________________________________________________
\p From the entire passage, what are the conditions needed for the promise of Jesus’ presence to be fulfilled?
\p ____________________________________________________________________
\p The great commission is the final instructions that Jesus gives to his disciples. We can summarize all of the law and our mission with the three imperatives of an obedient walk with God:
\li Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, [all your mind], and all your might.
\li Love your neighbor as yourself.
\li Make disciples.
\p If these are the three key commandments of the entire Bible, it is important that we understand them and consider how they apply to our lives. I encourage you to read Matthew 28:16-20 over again and ask yourself what it means and tells you and how you should apply it to your life.
\p So here are a few rules about making disciples.
\p \bd 1st Principle: You must be a disciple\bd* before you can make one. Jesus spent more than 2-1/2 years forming these men, so that they would be disciples who could hear from God. (Matthew 16:14-19) The Great Commission was given to disciples, not to the multitude of followers, nor the great crowds who believed in Jesus. You will find that making disciples is natural for a disciple. It is difficult or impossible for those who are not. This may be why so few professed Christians have little more than a passing interest in fulfilling the Great Commission. – “God hasn’t called me to this. Isn’t that the job of missionaries, evangelists, and pastors?” are not uncommon responses of Christians to the call to make disciples. There is truth in what they say, but it is more a statement of their relationship with Jesus than a calling of God.
\p Therefore, if your ultimate goal is to make disciples, let your first goal be to become a disciple of Jesus. Jesus sent the twelve (Matthew 10:1-6) first to the “lost sheep of the house of Israel.” Do not overlook other believers in your churches and fellowships. Invite them to join you in becoming disciples by applying what you learn here.
\p As you work through this material, you will have the opportunity to study and let the Holy Spirit teach you. As you respond in obedience to what the Holy Spirit shows you, you will find your understanding of Jesus’ mission becomes your own. Your understanding of the Bible and relationship with Jesus will both change and deepen. Making disciples will not only be something that you go to do. It will become part of all the activities of your life. When you are at work, in the grocery store, out to eat, even in church, you will find that the Holy Spirit brings people to you. These are the people you can bring to the scriptures and who Jesus will make disciples.
\p \bd 2nd Principle: Becoming a disciple is by invitation.\bd* We will see in John’s account of the calling of the first five disciples, that two were directed toward Jesus by another rabbi, two were called by other disciples of Jesus, and only one was actually directly called by Jesus. (John 1:35-46). Whatever the initial drawing you have to follow Jesus as a disciple, Jesus will confirm that to you and use you to invite others.
\p If you read through the sixth chapter of John, you will see that the road of discipleship requires ongoing commitment as we are challenged by Jesus. Many disciples forsook him because his teachings were hard to accept. To accept Jesus’ teaching meant to both believe and apply them to every area of their lives. To continue as a disciple you will have to know that he has the words of eternal life and there is nowhere else to go. (John 6:68)
\p Rick Warren in an interview, made the comment that Jesus first invites us to follow him with few obligations or demands, but as the disciple process continues, Jesus challenges us at deeper and deeper levels.
\p Jesus said it is better that he go to the father so that the Holy Spirit would come. (John 14:12 – 26) I trust that the Holy Spirit working through the words of the Bible will reveal to you the words of life.
\p Once you have accepted the call to be a disciple, start looking for people to invite into the discipleship relationship with Jesus that you are experiencing. (John 1: 41, 45) Disciples make disciples even if they have doubts, as long as they walk in obedience. Discipleship is a process and a life-style. It takes time and continues for a lifetime. Everything flows naturally out of your life when you are a disciple. Discipleship is caught not taught.
\p \bd 3rd Principle: Prayer\bd* is intimately involved in every aspect of being and making disciples. Paul commands us in 1Thessalonians 5:17, to pray without ceasing. We will take some time to discuss prayer a little later, but start now by committing yourself to consistent prayer as best you are able. Begin now by asking God to show you how to pray.
\p Seek to pray alone and corporately. Wherever and whenever you find people with a common heart, mind, and interest; “Pray!” Pray together with them at that time or in any situation. Whenever you feel a moving in your heart for something; “Pray!” It is the Holy Spirit who is present in at these times. When the Holy Spirit is present and gives us a burden, he is present to direct our prayers, and if he directs our prayers, he is present to fulfill those prayers. “Seek the Lord while he may be found.” When he is present, join him in prayer.
\ms4 First Century Discipleship
\p Definitions of words are tremendously important. I recall several years ago as I was joining a new church I was asked by the senior pastor to give a testimony. As we discussed what he wanted me to do, we both used the same words, but I seemed to be misunderstanding him. After a few minutes it became clear that although we were both using the same words, the meaning of several of those words had different definitions. Definitions are important.
\p We use words like faith and grace in ways that sometimes have meaning that are different than the intent of scripture. The result can be a misunderstanding of God, his nature, and his expectations. “Saved by grace alone” and “healed by faith” are uses of Biblical words that can negate God’s righteous justice or bring personal accusation. Giving careful reflection on the nature, source, and focus of grace and faith is important. These will be addressed later.
\p What does it mean to be a disciple? Jesus told us to make “disciples.” He never said to make converts. So then, what is a disciple that Jesus told us to make? To be a disciple of Jesus and accomplish what Jesus said to do requires doing it THE WAY HE SAID TO DO IT. This means imitating Jesus. The classical instruction method is by:
\li Telling and showing
\li Doing with the disciple
\li Watching and coaching the disciple
\li Allowing the disciple to function on his own while maintaining a relationship as advisor.
\p As disciples we should:
\li \bd Study\bd* and understand the scriptures and also learn from what others discover from it.
\li \bd Apply\bd* what is learned to our lives with someone to hold us accountable and help us.
\li Be \bd Mentored\bd* by another disciple.
\li \bd Submit\bd* continually to God.
\b
\p So where did the idea of discipleship develop? The first record of a teacher having disciples was about 400 BC among the Greeks. Most of us are aware that Socrates had many disciples, the two most famous were Plato and Xenophon. The practice of discipleship traveled around the Grecian world. Of all the places it reached, it was among the Jews of Israel that discipleship reached its zenith.
\b
\p Commentators have reflected on Paul’s use of the phrase “in the fullness of time” in Galatians 4:4 and Ephesians 1:10, saying that “the fullness” can be seen in the political environment of the first century Roman Empire. This included such things as a single multi-nation government, relatively safe land and sea transportation, a highway and navigation system, common language, and common currency. But it also includes the development of a system of rabbis and disciples based on the Greek model, but with a unique focus, the memorization and training in the Torah.
\p There were more than 800 rabbis who had disciples and were contemporary with Jesus
\li Gamaliel, John the Baptist – are mentioned in the Bible
\li Several had more than 1000 disciples
\p Ed Gross in his book \it “Are you a Christian or a Disciple?”\it* writes:
\p “\it There were at least five basic characteristics of official 1st century disciples. . . . As Michael Wilkins wrote,\it*
\p “\it From its very earliest use (in Greek literature), “mathetes” (disciple) was not simply a learner or a pupil in an academic setting. In fact, Herodotus, in whose writings the noun occurs for the first time in ancient Greek, uses the term to indicate a person who made a significant, persona, life commitment.\it*
\p “\it Socrates speaks similarly of disciples of the Spartan culture: “All these were enthusiasts, lovers and disciples of the Spartan culture; and you can recognize that character in their wisdom by the short, memorable sayings that fell from each of them.”\it*
\p Ed Gross summarizes, \it “Discipleship in the ancient world was a common phenomenon. It primarily involved commitment of an individual to a great master or leader . . . Jesus’ form of discipleship was misunderstood, even by some of his closest followers. But Jesus patiently taught his disciples what it meant for them to be his kind of disciple, his kind of follower.”\it*
\p ”\it So, what did it mean to be the disciple of Jesus? D. Thomas Lancaster wrote:\it*
\p “\it In the days of the Master, the disciples of the sages had four major tasks to perform:\it*
\li a. \it \bd To memorize their teacher’s words.\bd* The oral transmission process was the only inter-generational communication prac-ticed among the sages . . . .\it*
\li b. \it \bd To learn their teacher’s traditions and interpretations\bd*. A disciple learned how his teacher kept the commands of God and interpreted the Scriptures. Every detail about the teacher was important . . . . To a disciple, these were like gems and pearls meant to be gathered and treasured.\it*
\li c. \it \bd To imitate their teacher’s actions.\bd* A disciple’s highest calling was to be a reflection of his teacher. He sought to act, to speak and to conduct himself the same way in which his master conducted himself.\it*
\li d. \it \bd To raise up disciples.\bd* He created a new generation of students and transmitted to them the words, the traditions, interpret-tations, teachings, actions and be-haviors of his master.\it*
\b
\p “\it Many authors, while repeating the previous four characteristics of a disciple, would add one more mark of official disciples in their relationship to their teachers. It was foundational to all the rest, but absolutely necessary to be singled out and established as its cornerstone. . . .\it*
\li e. \it \bd To submit completely to the will of the teacher.\bd* 1st century rabbinic expert David Bivin wrote, “A special relationship developed between rabbi and disciple in which the rabbi became like a father. In fact he was more than a father and was to be honored above the disciple’s own father.”\it*
\p \it (\it*From \it “Are you a Christian or a Disciple?”\it* (pp. 45-47)*by Edward N. Gross)
\ms4 Jesus Modeled Discipleship for us.
\p As we study several passages in the gospel of John we will see that Jesus modeled being a disciple for us. We need only look at Jesus’ example to understand what he expects from us as disciples.
\ms4 Obedience
\iq1 \bd John 15:10\bd* If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
\ms4 Share from Memory
\iq1 \bd John 14:24b\bd* And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.
\ms4 Know all the Old Testament
\iq1 \bd Matthew 5:17\bd* Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
\ms4 Imitate and Conform
\iq1 \bd John 5:19\bd* So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise.
\ms4 Make Disciples
\iq1 \bd John 8:31\bd* So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, “If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples.”
\iq1 \bd John 13:35\bd* By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.
\iq1 \bd John 15:8\bd* By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
\p Discipleship is modeled and not merely taught.
\ms4 Scriptural examples of these five disciplines of Jesus disciples:
\p These five critical disciplines that were presented in \it Are you a Christian or a Disciple,\it* are not enumerated in a list in the scripture, but they are found individually in the commands of Jesus to his disciples and are affirmed by Jesus’ disciples. Rearranging to put the most important discipline first we have:
\p \bd Obey\bd* Jesus in everything.
\iq1 \bd John 14:15\bd* If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
\iq1 \bd Matthew 28:20a\bd* ... teaching them to observe [obey*] all that I have commanded you. \it (*my edit from the Greek.)\it*
\p \bd Know from Memory\bd* all Jesus’ commands and teachings so they can tell others.
\iq1 \bd Matthew 13:51-52\bd* Have you understood all these things?” They said to him, “Yes.” \v 52 And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”
\p \bd Know Old Testament\bd* and learn and accept Jesus’ understanding of it.
\iq1 \bd Matthew 5:21-22\bd* \em You have heard\em* that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.’ \v 22 \em But I say to you\em* that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire.
\p \bd Conform\bd* their life to that of Jesus in everything \it (thoughts, dress, actions, speech, etc.)\it*
\iq1 \bd Matthew 10:24-25a\bd* A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. \v 25 It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master.
\iq1 \bd Romans 12:2\bd* Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
\p Jesus mission to reconcile the world becomes our mission
\p \bd Make disciples\bd* after model of Jesus – \it (Mt 28:19) Go therefore and [having gone] make disciples of all nations\it*
\p Jesus, however, added a couple of qualifiers that other rabbis could not. These are extremely important in the discovery discipleship process.
\iq1 \bd Matthew. 28:20b\bd* And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.
\iq1 \bd Hebrews. 13:5b\bd* . . . for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.”
\iq1 \bd Matthew 18:20\bd* For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.
\iq1 \bd John 14:26-27\bd* But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.
\iq1 \bd Matthew 23:8-11\bd* But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. \v 9 And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. \v 10 Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. \v 11 The greatest among you shall be your servant.
\p Who is to do the discipling (teaching)? Who is to be our teacher?
\p _____________________________
\p As a disciple maker, what is our role in the discipleship process?
\p _________________________________________________________________________________________________
\p Based on these passages what would the discipleship process look like?
\p ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
\p The entire discovery discipleship process is based on this: if we gather in groups of at least two, obey Jesus’ words in the Bible, Jesus will ask the Father to send the Holy Spirit who will help us remember and teach us all things. (John 14:21)
\p The discovery process is the application of the promises of the scripture. It has been tested and found true by millions of people around the world. These scriptural promises validate my own personal experience of living as a disciple of Jesus. This is what makes this discipleship process exciting personally. You can become a disciple of Jesus, rather than a disciple of a godly man who points you to Jesus. The Holy Spirit really does show up to teach, change and transform you.
\p \bd The goal therefore, is to become a disciple who makes disciples.\bd* This process starts with the discovery Bible study (DBS) which is the third and core step of the discover process. (see figure 4.1)
\ms4 Implementation Assignment:
\p Contact people you identified (see Figure 2.1) and discuss what you have learned about being and making disciples (Matthew 28:16-20). Invite them to one meeting to look at this passage and discuss becoming disciples who will make disciples.

\ms4 Discovery Bible Study (DBS) Introduction:
\p Discovery Bible Studies are the core of the Disciple Making Movements Process. Typically individuals would prepare ahead of time by learning the passage so that they can tell it in their own words and then apply it to their own lives. There are five steps in this inductive Bible study process:
\p 1. Write the passage as it is written in the Bible, verse numbers and all;
\p 2. Write the passage in your own words;
\p 3. Write out one or two, “I will” statements;
\p 4. Write what you discover about the passage, about God, and about man.
\p 5. Write out your plan to share the passage with someone.
\p There are several formats to use for written discovery studies, the two page four-column (Figure 3.1) and the three-column method. (Figure 3.2) are the most common. There are also the one page four-quadrant portrait layout (Figure 3.3) and three-column landscape layout that you can use for shorter passages. (Figure 3.4). You will want to choose only one to introduce to a discovery group.
\ms4 Purposes of the Written Study
\p There are three main purposes in doing the discovery study.
\p First, is to commit a passage of scripture to memory in our own words, so that we can tell others.

\li What do we learn about God’s character, nature, and purposes?
\li What do we learn about man?
\p N.T Wright described the latter two as “Theology” – learning about God and “Anthropology.” – learning about man.
\p Thirdly, decide what one or two practical things you can do to start applying this passage to your life.
\p The question asked is:
\li If this passage is true, what changes will I make in my life to conform to it?
\p We do not assume or require that members of the discovery group of non-believers accept the Bible as true. We simply expect that they will compare their lives to what they have learned and make at least one small practical change the following week. Our expectation is that as they continue in this process, step by step the Holy Spirit will move them to understand that the scriptures of the Bible are true.
\p During the Group Discovery Study normally everything is done orally. If a group wants to write out the passage during the meeting, extra time (30 to 45 minutes) will have to be allocated.
\ms4 Write the passage out by hand
\p In the first column write the passage out by hand exactly as it is written in the Bible. This does a couple of things that aid in the memorization process.
\p First, the process of writing something down engages different parts of the brain. There are three mental process involved. There is the reading process. Then there is a “transcription” process, where the brain interprets and directs the hand to write. Lastly, there is the checking process where the brain compares what the hand has written with the original text. In each step the passage is being embedded in the mind.
\p The second thing that happens by writing the passage word for word, is that it forces you to look at each word individually. Words or phrases that were missed or “glossed over” in the normal reading process are noticed. This can give deeper understanding or other insights into a passage. This also aids in anchoring the passage in the memory.
\p For instance in my first study of John 15, “\it I am the \bd true\bd* vine and my Father is the vine dresser. Every branch \bd in me\bd* that does not bear fruit is taken away,”\it* as I wrote out the passage, the fact that Jesus called himself the “true” vine and the fact that he referred to every branch “in me” were two details that I had not noticed before and noticing them gave new depth of meaning to me.
\ms4 Choosing a Written Format
\p The order of the next two or three columns is optional and can be adjusted to fit your personal preference. Normally, you write it out in your own words, then write out at least one “I will” statements. The other three steps are normally completed in the discovery group.
\p If you choose to use the four column option (see figure 3.1) you will write out your discoveries in the fourth column.
\p If you write out your discoveries before your group meets, be sure to leave room to write out the “discoveries” of others in your next group meeting.
\p We will look at this more deeply in the next chapter.
\ms4 Write the Passage in your own words
\p What does it mean to write the passage in your own words?
\p The next step is to write the passage out in your own words. I normally try to do this without looking at the original passage as it aids my memorization, but the purpose is to be able to tell the story in your own words, not to make the process difficult. Depending on your creative versus literal thinking, you can write the passage close to the original text or weave it into a colorful story. I have heard dramatic presentations, I have seen it done in dialogue style, and I have seen it given in heartfelt literal presentations. This is what you will share with other people that God brings into your life.
\p The model for learning the passage in your own words can be found by comparing stories in Matthew, Mark and Luke. Each told the stories differently. They did not have Jesus words committed in a rigid way. They knew Jesus teachings deeply and shared from that understanding in their own words. The goal then for us, is to be able to replicate the same process of committing not only the words to memory, but to engraft them deeply into ourselves so that we can accurately convey them in a meaningful way to the people we are talking with. (Deuteronomy 6:6)
\p “\bd I will” and Discovery steps\bd*
\p The next two steps, the application and the discovery step, can be done in any order. The process of discovery is often omitted in your private study and completed during the group discussion of the passage. This is often preferable, but again it depends on your personal learning style as well as the cultural norms of your group.
\ms4 The Application – “I will . . .” step
\p The application step requires that you look at the passage and at the question, “How can I apply this to my own life?” Is there something I can change in my personal life, the way I relate to God, the way I treat others. One of the most difficult parts of this initially, is to come up with something that is practical and measurable; that you can report to your discovery group the following week.
\p For instance, I once had a woman tell me that a certain passage made her feel that she needed to pray for people to be healed. I asked her, ‘who will you pray for?” She said, “I don’t know.” I then asked her, “Do you know someone who is sick?” “Oh, she replied, “Yes I do. My mother-in-law has been sick.” “When will you see her next?” She said, “My husband and I visit her every Monday.” I asked her, “Can you pray for her then?” “Yes”, she said, “and \bd I will\bd*.” Praying for the sick in general is difficult to measure. What you want is your “I will” statements to be practical and measurable.
\p The other things to remember is that we are trying to learn to be obedient, one step at a time. Look at the way God deals with us. If he were to bring everything before you and say, “Change,” you would be overwhelmed; the task would be impossible. God has placed all of us in families for reasons. One of which is to learn how the training process works. An Olympic athlete starts as a baby, he began to crawl, he received encouragement from his parents and siblings. When he learned to walk, the parents told everyone with great pride, “The baby took three steps on its own.”
\p This is what obedience based discipleship is all about. It is a resolution to change a direction or part of your life and begin with a small measurable step. These steady changes fulfill what Jesus meant when he said, “Repent for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand.” Being a disciple of Jesus is a life of ongoing “metanoia,” the Greek for repentance, which means a change of mind and action.
\p Take a few moments to write out an “I will” statement. Then ask yourself, “In a week can I report definitely whether I did it or not?” When you are in a group and someone shares his “I will” statement, ask yourself, “When he reports the next time we meet, will his report mean anything specific?”
\p Spend some time the first few meetings with your own discovery group evaluating how practical each of the “I will” statements is.
\ms4 The Discovery Step
\p The final step in the process, which as I have said can come before the “I will” application, is discovering what the Holy Spirit wants to show you in a passage. I will add that sometimes when I am struggling to commit a passage to memory, I will complete the discovery step before I write the passage in my own words.
\p Most people complete the Discovery Step when they meet. Just as you keep track of each other’s “I will” statements for accountability, so you should record your group’s discoveries. They will augment what you personally discoveries.
\p In some cultures people are trained to believe that there is just one right answer. If people come with their list of prepared “discoveries” they may argue if someone proposes something different, or they may not be open to “hearing” what others have to say. So, how you handle this step is both a personal and cultural question.
\p There are three general questions to ask in this step.
\p The first: \bd “What is this passage about?”\bd*
\p You may need to do some additional reading to put the passage into context. When a passage includes a transitional word or phrase like, “therefore” or “after this” it is usually good to read what happened before, so you can put it into context.
\p When I explore a passage and am perplexed by it, I frequently ask God, “Why did you give me these words? Why did you say it?” Along with millions of seekers of God before me, “I will” testify that each and every word in the Bible has a purpose. If I don’t understand it, I need to ask God, and his Holy Spirit in time will reveal it to me. I say “in time” because God won’t answer a question that a person isn’t capable of accepting. This means, that the very act of pursuing a question of God may launch a person into a process of personal transformation.
\p The second question is: \bd “What does this tell you about God?”\bd*
\p For some passages there are clear illustrations of God’s character, personality, purposes, and expectations, commands, and promises to mankind. For others the answer may be more difficult to find, and it is even possible that there may be nothing apparent to us. One of the benefits of meeting with a group of other people to search the passage is that someone may look at it from a very different perspective and be able to point out something you had never seen.
\p The third question is: \bd “What does this tell you about mankind?\bd*
\p Sometimes we learn something about human nature, pride, ignorance, or how we relate to God or each other. You may uncover sins to be avoided or examples to follow. It is easier to see in others the faults that encumber you. All of these discoveries will influence your understanding and should influence your actions.
\ms2 Discovery Bible Study – Oral Method:
\p DMM was originally developed for use among non-literate people in northern India. Its use in much of Africa is also primarily among oral cultures. There are many immigrant communities in all the “literate” nations who not only cannot read nor write the language of their host countries, but cannot read nor write their own language.
\p Sociologists have noted that with the advent of widespread video media we are moving into a post-literate era. By that is meant that while most of the new generation of young adults can read, they do not do so for entertainment or recreation. Their preferable method of communicating is once again oral and visual.
\p Most of what we are studying here is oriented toward people who can read. In practical application, there may be occasions where you may need to know how to guide a discovery study among illiterate people.
\p In general, oral learners develop techniques of memorization that those who grow up in literate cultures do not. The result is that they are much more adept at memorizing large segments of scripture than those who read and write. The main challenge is getting the scripture to them in an oral form in the language they think in – their “heart-language.”
\p The easiest way to so this is to have a literate person read the scripture in the language of the hearers. If the Bible is not available in that language, then having a bilingual person translate from another language is satisfactory. The person reading needs to have a good grasp of both languages. Also, it is important to use a translation that is easy to read.
\p The third option is to use audio recordings. There are many organizations that are engaged in this undertaking and audio recordings of the Bible are available in hundreds of languages. I have a few friends in Uganda who work with the Ambassador Institute and have done this for large segments of the Bible which they use in their orality training.
\p With the widespread availability of smart phones, Bibles in over 700 languages are available in translation, many of them which can be not only read, but listened to. There are numerous resources available.
\ms4 Five Step Oral Study
\p There are five steps in the Oral process which cover the same materials as in the three and four column written study
\li 1. LISTEN - Listen to the passage being read two or three times.
\li 2. REPEAT - each person tells the story until able to tell the story in his or her own words
\li 3. DISCOVERY – What is the passage about and what do you discover about God and man?
\p One mnemonic device to use in oral studies is the SPECK method.
\p “S” stands for sin to avoid;
\p “P” stands for promise to rely upon;
\p “E” stands for example to follow;
\p “C” stands for command to keep; and
\p “K” stands for knowledge of God and man.
\p Is there a sin to avoid, a promise to rely upon, an example to follow, command to keep, or something we can know about God or man in the passage we have just learned?
\b
\li 4. What will you do if the passage is true? These are the “I will” and “we will” statements
\li 5. What is you plan to share with someone else?
\b
\ms2 Discover Group process – Five core elements
\p Discovery groups follow a process that moves logically to achieve the goal of forming a group of disciples of Jesus who in turn are able to fulfill the Great Commission.
\p Each of the following five steps accomplishes part of the discipleship process that seeks to conform as closely as possible to that used by Jesus.
\li 1. \bd Opening Questions: Community/Relationship Building\bd*
\p Learning to know and trust each other is essential to achieving unity in action and prayer.
\p The three simple questions:
\li • “What are you thankful for?”
\li • “What challenges do you have?”
\li • “How may we help you?”
\p Over time these questions will reveal insights and understandings of the members in a discovery group. The relationships of the members of the group will grow in both practical and spiritual ways. When the discovery group is made up of non-believers, the final question is meant to be practical and is important in developing a trusting unity.
\p It is important to understand that the time together is not meant to be a counseling session, but simply an opportunity for people to open up their lives to one another. If there are deep personal needs, the facilitator should make arrangements to meet with the person at another time. Prayer, however, in a group of believers is always appropriate. I usually have everyone write down the challenges and needs for prayer of everyone in the group. When I am facilitating a disciple making discovery group, I like to have different people volunteer to pray for someone else’s needs. We take a few minutes at the end of our group time to pray for those needs. The record of each person’s needs in these discovery groups becomes part of intercessory prayer..
\p The quality of conversation that can happen within a family or any social group when these three questions are asked and time is spent listening to the responses is amazing. Recently we had six of our grandchildren ages 6 to 12 spend a couple of days with us. At the dinner table I asked the three questions. We learned more about each other and our relationships within the families than we had ever heard at one time. The 8 year old told their entire family about how much fun it was when “Poppy” asked those three questions.
\p I have used these three questions to open conversation with store clerks, in business meetings, and at church socials. What is one thing that you are thankful for today? What is the greatest challenge or problem that you are facing? If the person seems open, I will ask if I may pray for their need. An opportunity to pray with someone invites the Holy Spirit into the situation. We will learn about “Shemah” statements later, but these kinds of open ended questions serve the purpose of discovering people’s openness to learn about God.
\li 2. \bd Review Questions: Encouragement and Accountability\bd*
\p There are three questions in this step:
\li • With whom did you share last week’s passage?
\li • Did you apply what you learned since our last meeting?
\li • How have you experienced God since the last time that we met?
\p These “accountability” questions should encourage people to fulfill their commitments. Numbers are frequently given that a person stands less than a 10% chance of fulfilling a commitment made only to himself, but more than 90% when a person voluntarily makes himself accountable to another.
\p Successful completion of commitments by one person encourages other members of the group. It can be very exciting when there is a supernatural response to a commitment. There was a woman during a training session in Africa, who was prompted to try to reconcile with a neighbor who had not spoken to her in two years. The neighbor’s response was overwhelming. She asked her forgiveness and in the conversation that followed the neighbor wanted to receive Jesus and learn to follow him.
\p Finally, this time is an opportunity for the group to listen to each other’s fears and difficulties in following through on their commitments. Prayers, advice and assistance are appropriate at this phase of accountability with groups of believers. One of the most important factors in the Kingdom of God is finding the moral support to persevere in our commitments. Discovery groups of friends who are pursuing the same goals can make a significant difference in each other’s lives in supporting each other.
\p I have witnessed “father’s groups” that changed entire families, where men challenged men with the words of scripture and encouraged one another through this accountability process.
\p I am reminded of the parable of the Sower and the seed in Matthew 13:
\p \v 4 \it And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.\it* \v 5 \it Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil,\it* \v 6 \it but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away.\it* \v 7 \it Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.\it* \v 8 \it Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.\it* \v 9 \it He who has ears, let him hear.”\it*
\p The support of a group of friends, who are engaged in becoming disciples of Jesus can move the seed off the path way and keep them from being devoured, it can remove some of the rocks and soften the ground with understanding, it can pull up the weeds and concerns of this world that seek to choke out the new life. In short these type of open, sharing, caring, and obedient groups can greatly increase the chance that the seed sown in their members will produce an abundant harvest.
\p When working with people who come from a culture or society that has no foundation in the Bible or is hostile to the words of the Bible, having discovery groups of people provides the social context to live as a follower or disciple of Jesus even in the midst of harassment or persecution. In hostile societies, persecutors have more difficulty oppressing groups than individuals.
\li 3. \bd Group Discovery Study\bd*
\p The heart of discipleship is allowing God’s words to engage every aspect of our lives. In a literate culture, the discovery process starts by everyone reading while one person speaks out-loud the words of the passage. This engages two parts of our brains simultaneously and produces translation, comparison and communication. During the second reading one person reads aloud while everyone else closes their Bibles and listens. The intent is that each of us will listen to understand. There is a scriptural reason as well. We know from Romans 10: \v 17 [that]*\it faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.\it* So, by reading the passages from the Bible out loud we are actually hearing God speak through each other.
\p The next step is to take turns trying to say the passage in your own words. The goal is that the group learns the passage together. I have a relative who has a Jewish background. One of the things that he had to do for his Bar Mitzvah was to memorize large segments of the Torah in Hebrew. I was amazed when he told me and asked him how was that possible? He said it is really very simple and easy. He and his group of initiates would follow the same process used here: Read it, say it out loud, say it by memory while others in the group listen and correct it based on what they remember.
\b
\p \it Our goal is to learn together, because together we learn faster, better and deeper.\it*
\b
\p This process dates back for more than 2000 years. It is probably similar to that Jesus and his contemporaries used. When you engage in this process, in twenty minutes or so you will have a good grasp of as many as a dozen verses. Initially many people are apprehensive and see this as an “examination”, but with experience, people quickly discover it is a great way to learn. Remember our goal is to learn together because together we learn faster, better and deeper.
\p Once everyone has had an opportunity to “engraft” the passage into their mind, we begin the process of discovery about the meaning of the passage while looking for what it teaches about the nature or person of God and about human nature as well.
\p The three questions to ask in the discovery study are:
\li What is the passage about,
\li What do I learn about God, and
\li What do I learn about man?
\p Sometimes it is useful in understanding the passage to read some of the preceding text. But during the study we want to confine all attention to the current passage.
\b
\p \it No preaching or teaching; only discovery\it*
\b
\p There is one rule in the discussion process. Confine all remarks to the passage being studied. That means no preaching or teaching. It is useful to get in the habit of challenging each other with the question, \bd “where does it say that in this passage?”\bd* (Or use a similar phrase.)
\p A comment may seem to be off the mark because the speaker is including his own preconceptions, extraneous doctrines or teaching. However, it could be that this person is looking at the passage from a really different perspective. This might give a deeper understanding after the group hears the explanation of the individual’s insight
\p On the other hand, I recently heard a discussion where a person stated that the great commission was the responsibility of all believers, when he had just read that it was a call given to the eleven disciples. Why? Because what he had been taught differed from what was in the passage and in his mind, it over-road what the passage actually said. When we looked at the passage again and compared it to what he had just said, he was able to adjust his thinking to match what the text said. There may be many things we have been taught or believe, that are not substantiated by the scriptures. By being challenged, we each have the opportunity to have our thinking brought into conformance with what God actually says.
\p An example of the opposite took place in one of my first discovery groups. A man made a statement of discovery that to me and everyone else in the group seemed totally unconnected. When challenged by “where does it say that in this passage?” he presented an amazing perspective on the passage that gave all of us a greater and deeper understanding of God. This commonly happens among people honestly seeking God and by this means the group can learn some very profound things about the scriptures, God, and themselves.
\p One of the most helpful dynamics is when everyone in the group shares what God is showing them. This group learning is more likely to be complete than studying as individuals.
\p There is reluctance of people to speak if they think they are in the presence of an “expert.” If a person brings in extraneous information, even if it is good, those who are not equally knowledgeable will remain quiet. By confining all remarks to the passage, everyone is on an equal footing. People learn that God speaks to them and indeed the “expert” learns too, whereas otherwise he might not.
\p There is another very practical reason to confine remarks to discoveries about the passage being studied; it allows the group to finish in a reasonable period of time. Being respectful of each other’s time is important.
\p If a person frequently brings in extraneous materials, particularly doctrines or teaching hostile or counter to what the passage states, he should be talked to one-on-one after the group. If there continues to be defiance, then ask him to leave is appropriate.
\p The second question, \bd “What do we discover about God?”\bd* is a challenge to not only look for direct references about God, but also discover His intent and action as revealed in this passage. The third question, \bd “What do we discover about man?”\bd* is similar to the first about God, but whereas people’s initial response to the question about God is to look for direct references to him, when asked about man, we usually immediately look at our own intentions, failures, successes, and actions. This often causes us to consider God’s different characteristics. For example, if the people in the story have done evil, we realize that God has a standard for good. If people are delivered, we realize that God is a deliverer.
\p Two things will occur during this three step process, first the passage will be understood more deeply and incorporated into your life and secondly, the Holy Spirit will have begun to speak inwardly about deficiencies and the need to change direction and activities.
\li 4. \bd Personal and Corporate Application\bd*
\p Hopefully, you will have entered your group time with some of your personal applications written down in the “I will” format. Sometimes during the group discussion, God may point out something else which will cause you to select another commitment area. Regardless of rather you change or keep the same “I will”, this is the place where you will make a personal commitment and ask that the group encourage and hold you accountable.
\p One of the group’s responsibilities is to visualize how they will know whether or not you have fulfilled your commitment. That is, the group needs to evaluate whether an “I will” statement is something that can be started within the next 24 to 48 hours and can be reported as being done, partially done, or not done at the next meeting.
\p In addition to your own application that you prepared before the discovery group meets, there is an opportunity to apply what the group discovered during its time to each person’s life. So, some additional “I will statements” may be generated.
\p A second aspect is the spiritual growth of the discovery group itself. One of the goals is that each of these groups will over time take on patterns of behavior and understandings that conform more closely to that presented in the Bible. As these groups progress through more of the Bible, some groups may eventually become simple churches that provide more support for the life of its members. (see Chapter 3)
\p There are also three application questions for the group:
\li • If this passage is true how does it change how we see God?
\li • If it is true how does it change how we treat others?
\li • If it is true, how does it change what we do?
\p This last question should generate a “We will” statement if it is applicable.
\p There are six different discovery series used in general when non-believers are disciplined to Jesus. These six series developed by \it CityTeam\it* and its partners, take about two years to complete and lead some of the groups to become simple churches. (see Appendix 2)
\li 5. \bd Concluding Questions: Outreach\bd*
\p The fifth and final step in the discovery process is to develop an outward focus. Jesus was always focusing his disciples’ attention on the needs of people around them.
\p You cannot be a disciple of Jesus unless you develop an outward focus. Jesus came to seek and save the lost. This is part of his mission and character. It should become ours as well.
\p The two critical steps in the discovery process are \bd application and telling others\bd*. They are the keys to respectively: personal transformation, maturity, multiplication, and the spreading of the gospel.
\p The first question in this step:
\p “\bd What other questions do you have about this passage?”\bd*
\p This question is intended to make sure that everyone in the group has a thorough understanding of the passage to be shared. It is not uncommon, that as the group discusses a passage that people in the group, may realize that there are things that they did not understand.
\p The second question is:
\p “\bd With whom will you share this story and how?”\bd*
\p Sharing the passage is particularly important both as a way of embedding the passage in each member’s mind and also in reaching other people in a non-threatening way with the hope of the gospel.
\p One of the keys to success in this part is to have a fairly detailed plan before you leave.
\li What is the name of a person who you may possibly tell?
\li Where will you be when you tell him?
\li How might the conversation go?
\li What follow-up question might you ask him?
\p Even if the plan doesn’t work out with that person, the work of preparing will increase the chance of sharing with someone else.
\ms4 The Final Questions:
\p These final questions usually require a group response, although individuals may respond as well. Jesus demonstrated mercy numerous times by delivering people who were demonized, healing the sick, raising the dead, and feeding the multitude. These acts were examples of Jesus engaging people at their points of deepest needs.
\p Whether the acts are small and short-term or large and ongoing, a discovery group needs a purpose and focus outside itself.
\li Do you know anyone who needs help?
\li What can this group do to help them?
\p These acts of service give discovery groups an identity together. They open doors to share with other people what God is doing, and can do. In fact as we will learn a little later, these actions help the group engage the people around them.
\p When I was teaching in Mexico, there was a lot of enmity between “Christian” believers and Catholics, Jehovah Witnesses, Mormons, and Seventh Day Adventists. As an example, our host family who were pastors of an evangelical church, every few nights would receive a bag full of rotting dead rats thrown over their fence. (I learned what the expression, “smells like a dead-rat” means – woo, pretty bad.)
\p Over the years walls of hostility had grown up between these believers and their neighbors. The result was that they withdrew and did not talk to their neighbors. They had developed a reputation of not only being separate, but being aloof. Finding ways to engage their neighbors, can begin to bring down some of those walls of hostility and offer opportunities to introduce others to Jesus; “come and see.”
\p Prayer should be introduced to each group by discovery. Groups of non-believers would not be expected to pray until it becomes one of their “we will” statements. However, if the discovery group is made up of believers, it is good at this point to pray for the individuals that each person in the group has selected to tell the passage he has learned. Jesus has promised to be with us to the end of the age. It is necessary to include him in your planning.
\ms4 When do you want to meet again?
\p When starting a new discovery group, the initial invitation should be for one meeting to see what a discovery group is all about. Unless the facilitator has a pre-established authority, or the meeting is part of a pre-established program, people will be more likely to commit to one “come and see” meeting. At the end of this first meeting, the facilitator should ask, “Do you want to do this again, and when do you want to meet?”
\p It is important that everyone in the group commits himself to continue meeting. If the subsequent meeting needs to be delayed or rescheduled, it is better to deal with it now rather than not have people show not up later.
\p Once a pattern has become established, this question does not need to be asked every week, but periodically, it is good to check with everyone.
\p As those of you who have been involved in training for sports, music, or dance know, proficiency comes after much practice of the basics.
\p A characteristic prevalent in Euro-American culture is the idea of grabbing an idea and integrating it into what we are already doing. Becoming a disciple is about imitation, about repetition, about being willing to try, to fall short, to learn from mistakes, and then try again.
\p I remember one of my daughters when she was four years old watching beautiful figure skaters on the ice. She so wanted to skate like that. So, one beautiful sunny day we rented some skates for her and she went out on the ice with these graceful skaters. The reality of beginning ice-skating is far from graceful. She felt more like an ugly duckling than a beautiful swan.
\p The reality of discipleship is the same. It involves learning both “what” to do and “how” to do it. This means practicing the basics until they are mastered.
\p I have a friend who was on his high school wrestling team. I explained to him the idea of imitation before improvisation. He had no difficulty at all with the concept. \it “I remember my coach teaching me a new move,”\it* he said, \it “every time he would come by and see me ‘improvising’ he would say, ‘Denny, what did I tell you to do? Well, do it the way I taught you!”\it*
\p \it Then after a few days, he came by one more time, watched me and then said, “Denny, you have it, now let’s see how you can improve on it.”\it*
\p Improvisation before thoroughly mastering the process will not produce the desired results of disciples who are transformed and make other disciples who make disciples. Once the process is fully internalized, adapting the process to meet specific circumstances is encouraged, but a person should never forget to practice the basics.
\p One of the stories of my adolescent years was about Vince Lombardi, the coach of the Green Bay Packers, who established that franchise as one of the significant ones in professional football. In the year of this story, the Green Bay Packers were ranked number one and their perpetual rivals, the Chicago Bears, were ranked near the bottom. However, the game turned out to be a rout of Green Bay and they were humbled in the Sunday exchange.
\p The next training day, Vince Lombardi gathered his humbled team together and said: “Gentlemen, football depends upon fundamentals and basics. That is what you forgot and is why you lost yesterday’s game. So, we will focus today’s practice on the basics.” Then he had one of his players hand him a football and he said, “This gentlemen is a football.”
\p The lesson from all of this is, plan to practice the process exactly as presented until you fully understand it and can do it by instinct. Oh yes, never forget to review the fundamentals.
\ms2 Small Group Acrostic - LOOP
\p A couple of good friends who have a ministry with the Navigators have developed a simple acrostic to help remember the essential steps of the discovery process.
\li What are you thankful for?
\li What challenges do you have?
\li How can we help you?
\li Who did you tell; what happened?
\li Did you complete your “I will”?
\li How have you experienced God?
\li Practice saying in your own words.
\li What is the story about?
\li What can we learn about God?
\li What can we learn about people?
\li How does this change how we see God?
\li How does it change how we treat others?
\li What will you do? “I will”
\li What will we do? “We will”
\li Do you have any more questions?
\li Who will you tell? What is your plan?
\li Who will we help? What is our plan?
\p Start a discovery group with the people you identified earlier both to practice and form a supportive “missional”/outreach group to participate with you in becoming and making disciples. Look over the STUDY GUIDE FOR DISCIPLESHIP TRAINING, just before Chapter 1.
\p Invite the believers who you identified in Chapter 2. (Figure 2.1) and others that you have thought of since, as being interested in engaging and making disciples to an one-time “introductory meeting.” In the meeting have them read Luke 10:1-11 out-loud and then watch the 6 or 8 minute video 2 – “Act Beyond Introduction.” Discuss how they see the principles in the passage being implemented in the video. Next, watch Jerry Trousdale’s “What are DMMs?” video 3 and discuss it. Finally, watch Part one of Ed Gross’ series on First Century Discipleship, video 5. (An alternative to Ed’s series is to watch video 4, Disciple Definition, by Richard Williams.) Ask them if they are interested in meeting again. Ask those that are to do the written discovery study below and watch video 7. Dave Hunt’s video on the Bible study process.
\p Have those who want to meet again do a written discovery study on Luke 10:1-11 in a notebook using the format in Figure 3.1 or Figure 3.2. As a suggestion start an index of passages you study on the first page and then number the two page sheets consecutively. This will be help in the future as you look back at your notes.
\p Appendix 3 has a list of detailed questions which may be useful as you begin to examine these scripture passages. Take a few minutes to look at them and decide if they will be useful to you.

\ms4 Where does discipleship start?
\p The discipleship process used by DMM has three integrated parts as illustrated in figure 4.1. The “macro” process is based on Luke 10 and Matthew 10. The disciple maker works with the person of peace as he or she facilitates a five part discovery group process with their family or social group.
\p The heart of the entire process is obedience-based discipleship which grows out of what the Holy Spirit reveals to each member from the Bible during the discovery Bible study (DBS).

\p Note: Appendix 3 has a list of questions that can be used to think through each passage these Bible studies. Some people may find this useful as they prepare their own discovery study of the passage.
\p As you go through these studies, your first mission is that of Matthew 10, to find people among your Christian friends who will be willing to join you in becoming disciples of Jesus and preparing yourselves to fulfill your part in the Great Commission of making disciples of those who do not yet know Jesus using the model of Luke 10.
\b
\p Every group should have a facilitator who has several responsibilities. In a training session, but not in a group of non-believers, this should rotate so that each person in the group has an opportunity to learn how to facilitate the process.
\li Facilitator is to maintain order
\li Facilitator, during the discovery step, is to assure that all comments pertain to the passage and that there is no teaching or preaching.
\li Facilitator should use questions to engage everyone in the group and make sure everyone has an opportunity to share.
\li Facilitator should see that group members record a list of other’s challenges, so that they can support each other between meetings.
\li Facilitator should keep track of each person’s “I will” statement and name of the person whom they will share the scripture. Use this during the next meeting.
\li Facilitator is a participant. He should participate in all of the parts of the process as an equal.
\p There are a couple of things that dictate optimum group size: amount of time available, making sure everyone has opportunity to share, and in a training situation, that everyone has opportunity to facilitate as many sessions as possible.
\li In general, plan to spend 15 minutes per person to complete all five steps. So, if there are four people in a group allot one hour. If there are six people allot 1-1/2 hours.
\li The depth and breadth of sharing improves up to six to eight people. After this some people typically will be passed over during sharing and discovery time. Larger numbers mean that attrition and occasional absence will not disturb the group interactions.
\p Having a combination of large group and small group times can improve the learning. Training groups of three to four people per small group provide fairly deep sharing while allowing more people to have an opportunity to lead one or more groups.
\p I have found that the following time schedule is very functional in a training session:
\li Large group opening session - 45 minutes
\li Small group discovery group - one hour for groups of four
\p Large group sharing and questions - 45 minutes
\p Large group times in the beginning can be used to give overviews, and discuss questions and passages from the previous session. Having a large group time at the end of a session when each small group can have “champions” tell the passage in their own words, share a few of their main “discovery about God and man” and ask questions in the large group setting helps solidify group identities and maximize learning.
\p Jesus’ teaching in this passage is key to understand the discipleship process that the disciples used. When Jesus told the disciple to make disciples in all the world, this is what they would have understood to be the method.
\p This will be your first full discovery group meeting. Check to see that everyone has completed at least the first two columns of the written discovery study. Now watch video 5, Dave Hunt’s presentation on “The Discovery Group Process” and take some time to read through the process described below. Discuss each step and read each of the three questions in each section before you start answering them. Chapter 3 provides an in depth explanation of the process and there is a concise outline of the process in Appendix 5. You can read through the “Review Questions” in section 2 of this process, but this first meeting you will not be expected to answer them. You will, however, do this section the next time your meet.
\p Conclude your meeting time by watching Part 2 of Ed Gross’ series on First Century Discipleship.
\ms4 The Discovery Group Process
\p It takes four or five sessions before people become completely comfortable with the discovery process. So, press on through the first few times. Understanding comes with hands-on practice.
\p Normally all of the discovery group time is oral. Group members are expected to have completed their personal written or memorized (in an oral culture) discovery Bible study before the group gets together.
\p If you want to include a written study, you will need to add 30 to 45 minutes to your meeting time.
\p \bd 1) OPENING QUESTIONS—\bd*• What are you thankful for today?
\p • What problems have you had today? \it (Write these down in your notebooks for ongoing prayer and future updates.)\it*
\p • Is there any way we can help you?
\p \bd 2) REVIEW QUESTIONS\bd*\it (start this at second gathering.)\it*
\p • With whom did you share the last passage?
\p • Did you apply what you learned since our last meeting?
\p • How have you experienced God?
\li \bd 3) DISCOVERY STUDY :\bd*
\p Have someone read the verses at least twice. The second time one person reads while the others just listen.
\p Then take turns trying to tell the passage in each person’s words covering all of the main points, with the group adding missing parts. The \bd goal\bd* is to learn together and be able to share the passage with someone outside the discovery group.
\p At least two people should take turns saying the passage in their own words by memory. The more times you do this, the greater the learning of everyone in the group. Usually, if four to six people share the passage in their own words, everyone will know the passage thoroughly
\p Once people are familiar with the passage and have put it into their own words, the group is ready to discuss the passage and share what they discover in it.
\p \bd Discuss the passage\bd*—
\p This is a discovery process. That means that no one is allowed to teach or preach. Participants are required to confine their remarks to the passage. Experience has shown that this keeps everyone at an equal status, i.e. there are no "experts" in the group; knowledge of all group members increases together; everyone grows confident to share, which adds to the breadth of sharing; it keeps extraneous doctrines from being introduced; and allows the group to finish in the allotted time.
\p \bd Challenge question: "Where does it say that in this passage?"\bd* Everyone in the group should learn how to challenge each other with this or a similar remark. The facilitator should encourage people to ask this question. Initially this may seem uncomfortable, but if the facilitator will encourage people, it will become part of the group culture in a few sessions.
\p As mentioned earlier, it is very common for different people to look at the same passage from very different perspectives. So, when challenged to explain their views, their response often becomes some of the greatest learning times in discovery groups.
\p A second point is that anytime a person has a discovery and can explain where they see that in the passage, the group needs to accept that as what the Holy Spirit is teaching that person. It has equal value to anyone else’s discovery. Remember the Holy Spirit is the teacher and he engages every person differently.
\p Members of the discovery group should write the groups responses to these questions down in their written journal.
\p • What happens in this scripture passage?
\p • What do we discover about God?
\p • What do we discover about people?
\p The goal of “I will” statements is to make small concrete changes in the life of each group member as voluntary acts. While group members are expected to hold each other accountable, they are not permitted to set expectations for others in the group. As a friend of mine was fond of saying, “we should confess our sins one–to–another, not one-for-another,” in other words let each person choose what they will do, without coaching or direction.
\p Having said this, a person who repeatedly refuses to make \bd any changes in his or her life\bd* should be talked by the facilitator after the meeting. Since these “I will” applications are an integral part of the discovery process, anyone who continually refuses to participate even after a time of counseling and encouragement, should be asked to leave the group.
\p Both individual and group “I or we will” statements should be measurable and doable before the next group meeting. If they haven’t been completed within one or two group meetings, have the person or group abandon this “I or we will” endeavor and move on to something new. (This is different situation than a person who refuses to participate.)
\p After discovering truths from God’s Word, identify what difference this makes in each of our lives.
\p • If this scripture passage is true, how does it change how we see God?
\p • If it is true, how does it change how we treat others?
\p • If it is true, how does it change what we do? \it (This is the point of drafting and committing to “I will” and “we will” statements.)\it*
\p Discuss as a group, other people with whom you can share who may be open to start a study with their social network. Each person should develop and share a plan to do this. It should include the name of the person, where and how it might take place, and what follow-up questions might be asked.
\p When one of the members of the group finds someone who wants to learn about God, another group can start. Your group member will help their new contact start a study at their home or with their friends. Coach and encourage your group member to, mentor the new “person of peace” (facilitator) to start a discovery group.
\b
\p The members of your group should pray for and support each other with each prospective contact. Anyone in a “believers” group may become the facilitators of new groups within their own social network or coach another person of peace to start a group.
\p • What other questions do you have about the passage?
\p • With whom will you share this story? And when and how will you share it?
\p • Do you know anyone who needs help?
\p • What do they need help with and what can we do to help them?
\p • When do you want meet again?
\p Have your group do a written discovery using three or four columns to study:
\p John 14:15–27*– Obedience and the Holy Spirit, our instructor. See Appendix 3 for study Questions
\p \it Miraculous Movements,\it* by Jerry Trousdale. Ch. 6 – “Discovery Bible Studies and Obedience Based Discipleship”
\periph Chapter 5. Learning Obedience
\ms1 Chapter 5
\ms2 Learning Obedience
\p The first thing that separates a disciple from a believer, or from a follower, is obedience. When Jesus proclaimed the good news, that the Kingdom of God was at hand, he made it clear that the requirement for entrance is repentance. While there may be sorrow or remorse in recognizing the need to repent, repentance itself is changing our way of thinking and the direction and actions of our lives to conform to the will and word of God; in other words, to obey the Bible in practical and observable ways. Therefore, obedience is the defining discipline of a citizen in the kingdom of God. As you do a discovery study on John 14:15-27 this will become apparent.
\p It is not uncommon for people to perceive Jesus’ commands to obey all that he teaches as being contrary to salvation by grace and not by works. This reasoning of course implies that there is something lacking in Jesus’ teachings. There is more to grace than academic understanding. As we look at obedience, it is worthwhile to see what more can be learned about grace and salvation.
\p There are four goals for this chapter:
\p First, that you will gain more experience and understanding of the purpose of each part of the discovery process. Second, that you will understand how obedience is connected to the discipleship process that Jesus taught. Third, that you will understand your role as a disciple maker. Finally, that you will begin to learn and understand some other things that are counter-intuitive to the many common approaches to discipleship practiced today.
\p Take a few minutes to review what you have learned so far about the discovery process:

\b
\p *What is the “challenge question” that everyone in the group should become comfortable saying?
\b
\p *What are some of the ways that you can you handle a long passage during the actual Discovery Study? (Improvise ideas.)
\b
\p Let’s start by thinking about how most of us who have a Christian background grew up thinking about obedience. Most Christian believers understand that we are saved by grace and not by works. (Romans 11:6) Somehow we have read into this that there is no connection between God’s grace and obedience and that obedience is a type of works. As you will find when you study John 14:15-27 obedience is directly linked with loving Jesus, which means that if you obey Jesus’ commands the Holy Spirit will reside in you and you will be fully reconciled with God.
\p N. T. Wright in a speech he gave in 2013 discussed the importance of having a working definition of grace. It is one of the key concepts of understanding salvation. He said that it wasn’t that there was any one set definition of grace, but each person needs to grapple with it for himself. The unmerited favor of God is wholly inadequate. He said for himself that he defined grace as: \bd “God’s presence in us to accomplish his purposes through us.”\bd* This is pretty close to my own personal definition of grace as \bd “the power of God working in us and through us to accomplish his purposes for his glory.”\bd*
\p In other words grace is the abiding presence of God with us as we love Jesus and obey him, just as Jesus loved and obeyed his father in heaven.
\p Ed Gross addressed this false dichotomy between grace and obedience in his book, \it Are You a Christian or a Disciple:\it*
\mi “\it The pride of many Evangelicals is the Great Commission. Yet, in His Great Commission Jesus said,\it* “teach them to obey everything I have commanded.”\it The prayer of many Evangelicals is,\it* “Your kingdom come.” \it But, the very next petition of The Lord’s Prayer following that petition is,\it* “Your will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.”\it And how do angels in heaven do the will of God? Is it by hearing His command and altering it or by obeying it explicitly? We know the answer. The word “angels” means messenger. They are given a message to deliver or a mission to perform and they do it. When we do His will on earth like the angels do it above, we live like disciples. We obey explicitly. Evangelicals certainly will never do away with either missions or prayer, But, devaluing obedience in them both actually alters them, leaving us with something other than what Christ commanded about either mission or prayer. . . .\it*
\pi \it How many Evangelical missionaries define their goal today in terms of new converts who obey everything Christ has commanded? If not, it is no small omission.”\it* (From Chapter 9 pp. 135, 136 of Ed Gross’s \it Are You a Christian or Disciple)\it*
\p Ed has been greatly influenced by the writings of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Following are a few of Bonhoeffer’s remarks about obedience
\p “\it Humanly speaking, we could understand and interpret the Sermon on the Mount in a thousand different ways. Jesus knows only one possibility: simple surrender and obedience, not interpreting it or applying it, but doing and obeying it. That is the only way to hear his word. The only proper response to the word which Jesus brings with him from eternity is simply to do it. Jesus has spoken: his is the word, ours the obedience.” (p. 219 of The Cost of Discipleship)\it*
\p “\it All along the line we are trying to evade the obligation of single-minded, literal obedience. How is such absurdity possible? What has happened that the word of Jesus can thus be degraded by this trifling, and thus left open to the mockery of the world? When orders are issued in other spheres of life there is no doubt whatever of their meaning. . . . Are we to treat the commandment of Jesus differently from other orders and exchange single-minded obedience for downright disobedience? How could that be possible?\it*” (p. 90 of \it The Cost of Discipleship\it*, Dietrich Bonhoeffer\it .)\it*
\p This may be an issue that you will have to work through in accepting the call to be a disciple of Jesus. For some people this may be a stumbling block, but as you search and pursue Jesus’ words, the Holy Spirit will be with you to conform your thinking to the words of the Bible.
\p Let us look again at the Discovery Group Process. There was one section of the discovery process that we did not do in the first study, the second one, “Reporting for accountability and encouragement.” Hopefully by this time you have attempted and completed at least one “I will” and / or “We will” statement and that you have made an attempt to share the passage you studied with another believer. Remember, that these passages that we are studying are intended to prepare people who identify themselves as followers of Jesus, to become disciples who are able to reach and make other disciples for Jesus. The passages in the “discovery God” series (see Appendix 2) are designed to engage non-believers.
\p Let’s review the three questions:
\li • Did you do what you said that you would do?
\li1 • What happened?
\li • Who did you tell?
\li1 • What happened?
\li2 • How have you experienced God since the last time we met?
\p This second step adds accountability and it also provides an opportunity to encourage one another with results of our obedience. One of the wonders of the disciple process is that Jesus “is with [us] even to the end of the age.” As we step out in obedience and apply what the Holy Spirit shows us, sharing the words of God that we have learned by telling others, Jesus will show up and accomplish amazing things. These stories, whether they be frequent or occasional, are not only encouraging, but build faith and teach much about the ways of God.
\p The accountability and encouragement step is where things get real. It is what gives impetus to the spreading of God’s word. It brings transformation in the way a person thinks and perceives of God. It changes our lives and the lives of those around us. It is the step that extends and builds up the Kingdom of God. Without the application, we have a Bible study and a small group, but in reality we are just spinning our wheels and going nowhere.
\p The application of the “I will” and “we will” statements and sharing the stories are the most challenging parts to get started and do consistently, but once they are established they produce a new level of expectant life in the discovery group. As you facilitate groups or train others to facilitate groups, use the accountability and encouragement step to reinforce application and sharing of the passages.
\p One question sometimes asked is, “should the group keep adding uncompleted commitments to a list.” Let me give two answers. First, the accountability step should be a time when members examine why they were or were not able to complete the commitments made and what happened. Were they too ambitious, not clear enough, or was their some confusion about what the group member was going to do? Particularly the first few meetings, the group should discuss what they can do to be more successful, or apply successes that one has had to the challenges of another.
\p Secondly, don’t overburden each other with incomplete “I will” statements. God can bring the same thing up again at a later date. After a couple of weeks, forget what lies behind and press on to the “upward call of God in Christ Jesus,” In other words, lay aside partially completed “I will” statements and move on to the new.
\p By this time hopefully you have found at least one or two other friends or acquaintances with whom to form a discovery training group and share what you are learning. Remember that you wrote down a list of people and have been praying to find a few that will join you in this endeavor. (see figure 2.1) Take some time and evaluate your progress in this area. This is a good time to “get serious with God” about what he wants you to do in becoming and making disciples.
\p This study presents a portion of Jesus’ teaching on obedience and the roles of the Holy Spirit in the discipleship process.
\p You should have completed a three or four column written discovery study before your group meets, unless your group has decided to take the time to write it out when you are together.
\p Once you have completed your written study, meet with your discovery group (that should consist of at least 2 and not more than 12 members.) Do the entire five part discovery process, adding in the Accountability and Encouragement portion – the goal is to help each other obey what they believe God wants them to do.
\p Start by watching video 8, Obedience, by Jerry Trousdale and Part three of Ed Gross’ series on First Century Discipleship.
\li Take some time immediately during the introductory questions to give thanks to God for the things that the group members share. (This is just for groups of believers - there is no expectation that non-believers would pray or give thanks to God, until they are led by the Holy Spirit to do so.)
\li Write down each problem that your group shares. If there is a practical way of helping resolve it, write that down as well. If prayer is needed write that down. Use this list to pray at the end of your time together. If there is a matter that is particularly important, each person in the group should add it to their daily prayer time. One of the most important things you can do is pray for the needs of the members of your discovery group.
\li During the oral discovery study after the group has practiced saying the passage out loud in their own words and discussed it, write down as many of the group’s discoveries as possible. This is for each person’s reference as they go back and review what God has shown them.
\b
\li Next, write down \bd all\bd* of the “I will” and “we will” statements as well as the names of the people who each person proposes to tell what they have learned. These are the practical commitments that people make to help one another for which each group member will give a report the next time they meet.
\li The last item is to identify a “group project” for the discovery group to reach out beyond themselves by meeting a need that others who are not involved in the discovery group have.
\p If the discovery group consists of people who are not-yet believers, this is a random activity to help the group expand its influence. By reaching outside the group, new relationships are formed. This both reduces possible future hostility and increases the possibility of future multiplication.
\p For your group of disciple makers, it should be an intentional action to begin engaging the people and groups of people you want to reach.

\periph Chapter 6. Purpose of the Discovery Process and the Counter-Intuitives of Discipleship
\ms1 Chapter 6
\ms2 Purpose of the Discovery Process and the Counter-Intuitives of Discipleship
\p The Discovery Process tries to replicate the discipleship process that Jesus used. It is not exact, but that is the goal. There is no complete list of the steps that Jesus used with his disciples, but there are enough examples to form a basic framework of what discipleship looks like. As you will see, Jesus gave specific instructions about our relationships in the discipleship process. He sent disciples out two by two. He gave instruction about prayer, about where they should go, and about what they should do. The discovery process described here seems to produce similar interactions that Jesus’ disciples experienced.
\p Another feature of the discovery process is that it is designed to prepare non-believers to worship God. Let’s look at the intended outcomes of each section and question when working with a group of people who are not yet believers.
\li 1. \bd COMMUNITY: Opening Questions:\bd*
\p These first three questions are wonderful for getting people to open up and share deep parts of their lives with one another, but they are also preparing people to be open to God. They quickly build a community bond with people in the group, and they initiate a bonding with God Himself.
\p The first question:
\p “\bd What are you thankful for this week?”\bd* This question prepares people to worship God. When working with non-believers don’t mention prayer, until the members themselves discover the need for it. However, for a group of believers, prayer should be an integral part of this step.
\p The second question:
\p “\bd What are your needs or challenges?”\bd*
\p This prepares people for intercessory prayer. It is important to reiterate that meetings are not meant to be counseling sessions. The giving of personal advice or counseling should happen outside the meeting.
\p The third question:
\p “\bd Is there some way we could meet any of these needs?”\bd* This teaches practical service and carrying for one another.
\p At the end of this section if the members of the group are believers, I often have them write down prayer requests for one another and then pray at the end of the meeting time.
\li 2. \bd SHARE EXPERIENCES: Review Questions:\bd*
\p The first two questions in this section are the most important in the entire discovery group process. They are a challenge. The accountability and encouragement that comes from each person successfully doing what they said they were going to do builds comradery and confidence over time.
\p The first question, \bd “With whom were you able to share what you learned last week?”\bd* trains in evangelism as well as accelerating learning and spiritual growth.
\p The second, \bd “How did you apply what you learned last week?”\bd* teaches obedience which leads to loving God. (John 14:21)
\p The faithful completion of these first two commitments develops good habit patterns which facilitates spiritual growth as well as practical disciplines, which transfer to other areas of life.
\p It is easy to side-step and to avoid the demands of personal discipline. Assuring that this happens requires that the facilitator maintain consistent standards of obedience, while encouraging members of the group to both set realistic goals and to follow through with them.
\p The discipleship process has been designed in such a way that we are forced to make decisions, to exert physical, mental, and emotional effort as well as experience successes and failures. All of this is in keeping with God’s plan to prepare us for our role in the eternal kingdom of God.
\p Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6:3, \it “Do you not know that we are to judge angels?”\it* What kind of training do we who were \it “made a little lower than the angels”\it* (Psalm 8:5 NKJV) need to have to be qualified to judge angels?
\p When I was first struck with this question, it seemed impossible to me. I asked how can this be? Then the passage “\it God is Spirit and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth\it*” (John 4:24) came to mind. Likewise, I recalled that angels are spirits without physical bodies and I therefore assume the ability to experience what we experience.
\p So, later when l read that it was said of Jesus who was God incarnate, that “\it he learned obedience by the things he suffered\it*.” (Hebrew 5:8). I realized that if God’s incarnation afforded him a unique opportunity to learn obedience, then what Jesus is offering us in this life is a transformational opportunity with eternal consequences.
\p I think of all the opportunities that I had to learn when I was young. As I matured, I found that everything I did learn opened up opportunities and enabled me to do many things and enjoy more of life. I also found that those things which I could have learned, but did not, limited my abilities and opportunities. I live today with both those blessings and limits.
\p When I consider that our heavenly father has offered each of us the opportunity to learn from the greatest of all teachers as his disciple, I am challenged by this unique opportunity and realize that it has eternal implications.
\p Certainly one of the things that happens during the process of obedience based discipleship is that people are transformed by the renewing of their minds. This transformation has eternal benefits.
\p The third question, \bd “How have you experienced God since the last time we met?”\bd* trains people to be aware of God working in their lives and in the world.
\p The discovery process is centered on hearing from God through what the Holy Spirit shows us in the Bible. This third question leads us to recognize that God also speaks through many other means. This includes the events of our everyday lives, answers to prayer, words we receive from God directly, and prophetic words other people speak to us.
\p God was actively involved and speaking to people before a single word was ever written down in the Bible. Every story in the Bible itself came from God’s direct intervention in people’s lives. The discovery process seeks to establish a foundation of deeply understanding of the Bible. This question about experiencing God should help us increase our ability to hear God speak to us, and to see him at work in our lives and the world around us.
\p One of the strengths of a team that is experienced in the group process is its ability to encourage members to achieve more and fulfill their potential.
\p Accountability provides opportunities to support each other in fulfilling commitments. In my current Saturday morning discovery groups I am frequently challenged by other members to think differently as to how I can apply the scripture passage that we have been studying.
\p In leadership development training, it is frequently stated that a commitment without accountability will be completed less than 10% of the time, but where there is voluntary accountability, the success rate is about 90%. Accountability reduces the chance of forgetting commitments or making excuses that cause us to fail. Accountability is not a discipline or a correction tool that the group uses, but it does challenge each person to give an account of himself. Ultimately, we are accountable to ourselves and to God, but the support and encouragement of a team or group can bring us into greater fulfillment of what God wants for our lives.
\p The other side of accountability time, is that it provides opportunities to encourage one another with past successes and give new ideas for future success. I recall a young man sharing that he decided to share a passage that his group was studying with a friend at school who was very depressed. He relayed that as he shared the passage, this classmate told him that he had been contemplating suicide. Sharing the passage led to a turn around in the classmate’s life and he began attending church with the young man and he also went to a counselor. Stories like these help to realize that Jesus indeed “is with us even to the end of the age.”
\li 3. \bd DISCOVERY: Bible Study\bd*
\p The discovery study has rightly been called the engine that makes the discovery process work. The words of the Bible have been given to us to reveal ever more about God’s nature. Because the Holy Spirit has also been given to us to teach and remind us of all things, we can come to know more, and experience more of God. It is this interaction between God’s Word, the Holy Spirit and our obedience that transforms us over time.
\p Reading and writing the Bible passage word-for-word as it is in the Bible – causes participants to focus on the Bible as authoritative, not as human opinion.
\p “\bd How would you say this in your own words?”\bd* leads participants to understand scripture.
\p The second question, \bd “What does this teach me about God?”\bd* leads to deeper worship and knowledge of God. N. T. Wright, in a speech, referred to this step as developing personal and group theology.
\p The third question,\bd “What do we learn about man from this passage?”\bd* is what N. T. Wright called developing anthropology. It gives us insight into what God expects us to be as individuals, families and the church.
\p If anyone significantly mistakes anything critically important, then members of the group should ask them, \bd “Where did the Scripture (this passage) say that?” (\bd*Ignore minor mistakes). This trains the group to give Biblical guidance and correction. It is also the key to growing in proper (orthodox) understanding of the scriptures.
\p It is important to recognize that when a group of non-believers first starts, they will \bd not\bd* have a correct understanding of God. As when God created the heavens and the earth, “\it the earth was void and without form,”\it* just as God over the six days of creation brought increasing order and meaning, over time the discovery process leads to greater clarity of understanding about God and our relationship with him.
\p When facing the initial errors and misunderstandings, the facilitator and mentor need to restrain themselves from giving “the correct answer.” Rather, they should use probing questions and the key one, “Where does it say that in this passage?” which challenges the speaker to show how their remark is based on the passage being studied. This will over time provoke a deeper learning and greater dependence and conformance to the Bible.
\li 4. \em \bd OBEDIENCE APPLICATION\bd*\em**
\p “\bd I Will and We Will Statements”\bd* must be practical and measurable in 24 to 48 hours.
\p Obedience is the key discipline that transforms good Bible studies into a disciple making process that can fulfill the Great Commission. There is a “feed-back” loop between loving God and obeying God. It is this cycle of growing more in love with God as we obey, that eventually leads non-believers to entering the kingdom of God and receiving the fullness of a living eternal relationship with Jesus.
\p “\bd I will change my daily life to reflect the reality that I have learned”\bd* is the transformational part of the discovery process for both the individual and the group as a whole.
\p The first of the three questions in this part of the discover process, \bd “If this scripture passage is true, how does it change how we see God?”\bd* is meant to be a time of discussion in which the members decide how to apply what they discover from the Bible study to the way they think about God individually and as a group. Together the group begins to form a unified understanding of who God is.
\p The second question, \bd “If this is true, how does this change how we treat others?”\bd* is a discussion in which the members decide how begin to change how they behave toward other people, personally and collectively as a group.
\p The final question, \bd “If it is true, how does it change what we do?”\bd* is the point at which individuals make their commitment to the group in the form of one or two “I will” statements that they will complete in a week. Again, the exact content of these are voluntary commitments, but each member of the group is expected to find at least one concrete things in the passage that they can change in their life in obedience to what they have read.
\p Likewise, when a passage presents a clear message, the group should commit to standards of practice that they will hold to in terms of their understanding of God and how they relate to both one another and to those outside their group in the form of “we will” statements. It is by this means that a group of individuals begins to take on a collective identity and begin to resemble evermore closely the “body of Christ” which Paul speaks of in his epistles.
\li 5. \bd OUTREACH: Concluding Questions :\bd*
\p The first question in this final series, \bd “What other questions do you have about this passage?”\bd* is here to make sure that each member of the discovery group is prepared to share the passage with understanding.
\p It is not unusual that as the discovery process develops during the discussion, that some of the members will develop new questions that they didn’t have before the discussion and their questions may not have been answered.
\p The second question, \bd “With whom will you share this story, when, and how?”\bd* is preparation for evangelism.
\p If participants each develop a plan, they are much more likely to be successful in sharing with someone else. Choosing a person to share the story with, helps each member of the group think about their possible contacts that the story they are learning would apply to. The Holy Spirit has opportunity to work here. Thinking through the process of starting the conversation and follow-up questions helps overcome the initial fears and hesitation.
\p The discovery group member should not be expected to follow this plan exactly. Many things will intervene. What is important is that they share the story with at least one person each week. Like all plans, these verbal plans only form a basis that the group members can start from as they reach out to others. As the members of the group mature and grow more comfortable, the group may increase their commitment to share with two or three people each week.
\p The third question is a pair of questions, \bd “Do you know anyone who needs help? What can this group do to help them?”\bd* This is the outreach and community engagement question.
\p New believers can quickly find themselves isolated from others in their community as their behavior and beliefs change. By staying engaged with non-believers in their community through service and by demonstrating love, the suspicions of outsiders is reduced and the positive interest in what is happening in the discovery group increases.
\p During a three-day training I gave in southern Mexico to a group of Evangelical Christians from several churches, they shared stories about the discrimination that they experienced from their neighbors. One man had been thrown into jail for witnessing to people in a fairly good sized town about 30 miles away. It took several weeks and many requests before the federal police to come in a free him.
\p By having discovery groups from the beginning, reach out and demonstrate real care and concern for their neighbors, these walls of hostility should not develop. Where they exist, as in these communities, these acts of kindness are the best means of bringing them down.
\p This question produces a commitment to continue meeting. It teaches that every step we take closer to God, takes a decision on our part.
\p Lastly, \bd Pray for needs\bd* of the members of a discovery group of believers and for the people with whom you will share and help. This would \bd not\bd* be an expectation for a group of non-believers until they had reached the point of wanting to pray for one another. This is also is a good time to pray for healing and allowing the Holy Spirit demonstrate himself among the group.
\ms2 Counter-Intuitives - Though Biblically based it is different
\p Almost all Christians find something about DMM that feels uncomfortable. My own challenges involved my understanding of “salvation.” In my training, I understood that salvation was always an individual interaction between “sinner” and Jesus. The accounts in Acts of entire families being baptized seemed to me to be “unscriptural,” a cheap form of salvation that could not be valid. I never considered that it was my thinking rather than the Bible that needed correcting. The idea of obedience-based discipleship seemed vaguely to diminish the idea of “salvation by grace.” For some people thinking of the idea (as told by Jesus) that the Holy Spirit will teach us and that Jesus Himself will be with us, seems impractical. But what do the scriptures teach?
\p One of the first challenges for Christians is to confront the way they have been taught and the things have been done in the past with what the scriptures teach. Becoming a disciple means “unlearning” some religious ideas.
\p An interesting side-note is that most non-Christians don’t have such problems. I recall my own experience when I was an atheist. I had just had an amazing encounter with the power and presence of God. I did not wonder if this experience was correct doctrinally. I simply knew that I had experienced God. Thankfully, I had people who directed me to read the Bible.
\p In addition to the challenges to our own “religious” world-view which need to be addressed by seeking God in the scriptures, there are some practical things which make disciple making movements grow. Let’s take a look at these “counter-intuitives.”

\ms4 Multiplication of Discovery Groups to the fourth generation

\p Figure 6.1 – Illustration of multiplication to Discovery Groups to the fourth Generation \it(Act Beyond - Beyond.org)\it*
\b0
\li \bd Go slow so you can grow fast\bd* – When speaking of rapid multiplication of discovery groups and churches, the assumption is that DMM is something like mass evangelism on a group rather that one-on-one basis. It is actually the exact opposite of that. The fact is, the disciple making process is a long term relational process with one or a few people.
\p The job of the disciple maker is to establish the first group by means of working through the person of peace, who in turn will facilitate this group and encourage the multiplication of other groups as Figure 6.1, which we also looked at in Chapter 2, illustrates. The disciple maker’s goal is not to start hundreds of discovery groups himself, but to work through a few people who will faithfully carry on this process until literally millions of people are reached. David Watson, shared in a conversation, that his direct down-line includes over 2-1/2 million new believers in the 25 years since he had started implementing DMM.
\p Typically, a disciple maker will spend between one and three years meeting regularly with a new facilitator and mentoring him or her. The disciple maker will then maintain an ongoing, but not so intensive relationship, for perhaps a lifetime.
\li \bd Focus on a few (one) to win many –\bd* Learning to mentor people is one of the essential skills of a successful disciple maker. Growth comes as the facilitator and members of his group find other people who God is drawing to Himself. This has at least two implications for you as a disciple maker. First, you must be prepared to spend a lot of time in developing this primary relationship. Second, if you want to be effective as a disciple maker, you need to be realistic as you assess the abilities and willingness of your mentee to put into practice all that you are leading him to discover.
\p If the facilitator you are mentoring is not up to the challenge of “bringing in the harvest” within his social group, then an early exit is advised. That doesn’t mean you “drop” the person, but it does mean that you look to invest your available time with other people who are both willing and able.
\p Tim Miller in his book \it Poised for the Harvest, Braced for the Backlash,\it* speaks of looking for a “Saul of Tarsus.” Not many of us will be an apostle like “Paul.” Most of us are more like Ananias of Damascus in Acts 9.
\p \v 17 \it So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”\it*\v 18 \it And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized;\it*\v 19 \it and taking food, he was strengthened.\it*
\p \it For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus.\it*\v 20 \it And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “He is the Son of God.”\it*
\p Ask God to prepare you to reach one or two people like Saul as a person of peace. Likewise ask God for a few faithful people like Timothy and Titus who can replicate disciples of Jesus. Mentoring people in the disciple making process is usually a long-term investment of your time; we want to send our time as fruitfully as possible.
\li \bd Share only when people are ready to hear. Walk away if the time is not right\bd* - This is simply the application of Matthew 10:14 and Luke 10:10-11. When leaving a group of people, you are \bd not\bd* making a statement of “never,” but rather “not now.” Perhaps more prayer is needed, or an engagement effort needs to be modified, or God needs to bring a disciple maker with different skills or anointing, or perhaps more time is needed.
\p When or if, to leave people after an investment of time and effort is one of the more difficult decisions that a disciple maker needs to be able to judge and make.
\li \bd A new insider is more effective than a highly trained “\bd*\it \bd mature\bd*\bd ”\bd*\it*\bd outsider –\bd* This is contrary to the evangelistic practice that is rooted in making converts and training them to a high level of knowledge and spiritual maturity before releasing them to make more converts (from their now likely estranged family and clan.)
\p The obedience based disciple making process capitalizes on the not-yet-a-believer’s existing relationships to invite them into the same discovery process that the person of peace is going through. Of course this requires the close and ongoing mentoring described in the first and second counter-intuitive in this list.*
\li \bd A lay church planter is more effective than a paid professional church planter\bd* - Sociologically, people receive more easily from others of similar education, economics, age and cultural background.
\li \bd Start with creation, not Christ\bd* – God began his story from the beginning. It was not an accident that He walked mankind through a process of discovering: their need, who He is, what He offers, and what He expects. Why do so few people fully live their lives for Jesus after confessing their sins, asking him to forgive them and save them? Could it be that all they want is to be forgiven and go to heaven without ever discovering the great work that God is offering them, to participate in bringing His kingdom to Earth?
\p Starting with creation allows people to discover God’s plan and the purpose Jesus came. The passages selected foreshadow who Jesus is and what his actions mean. When the members of the discovery groups arrive at the gospels, they have acquired all of the pieces needed to assemble a full understanding of what Jesus offers us. In the discovery process, they have been living out genuine repentance in obedience to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Entering into God’s kingdom and accepting Jesus’ gift of redemption is placed upon a solid foundation that will have equipped them to also make disciples of all nations.
\li \bd Don ’ t teach the Bible! Teach people how to discover truth from the Bible and how to obey. (Matthew 28:19)\bd* What would be different in churches today if everyone in a congregation was actively searching the scriptures to discover God’s purpose for their lives and the church, and were working to put it into practice? What kind of sermons would be preached if people in the audience would occasionally ask the pastor, “Where does it say that in the Bible?”
\p One of the powerful effects of teaching people to search the scriptures and apply it, is that groups of people engaged in this discipleship process grow in knowledge of God’s truth. They develop increasingly “orthodox” beliefs.
\p A good friend of mine, Emma May Hutchinson, who was a missionary in Zambia until a few years before her death, told me that the reason that she started a Bible school to train pastors was that at least 90% of pastors and Christian leaders in that country held significant heretical beliefs and teachings. People followed the man, not the word of God.
\li \bd The leader is a facilitator not a Bible teacher\bd* – Training people to facilitate and not to teach is an ongoing challenge when Christians lead groups. It is usually not as difficult with non-Christians, but it still takes vigilance and repetition.
\li \bd Let the lost lead Bible studies\bd* – For many trained Christians, this is a very difficult concept to accept. It works for two reasons. First, the discovery process confines the discovery group members to studying the passage and no extraneous teaching or conjecture is allowed. Second, it works because the facilitator even though he is not yet a believer, is being mentored each step of the way. This is another reason for the strong focus on long-term mentoring.
\li \bd Disciple to conversion\bd* – There is no standard definition of when a person becomes a disciple of Jesus. Is it when they start studying the Bible, when they start studying Jesus teachings in the gospel accounts, or is it after they have accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior? Whatever your thoughts, the “process” of discipleship begins once a person begins the discovery process. The intent is that they will continue growing in their understanding and personal experience of God throughout the disciple process until they eventually reach the place of personal repentance, surrender, and commitment to Jesus. At that point, they are believers in Jesus Christ. This is what the “Discovering God” series is about.
\li \bd Prepare to spend a long time, but anticipate miracle accelerations\bd* – When Jesus says that he will be with us “to the end of the age”, is that true? If it is and he is with us, can we expect to see miracles occur? The many years of experience with DMM in different parts of the world demonstrate that miracles don’t always occur, but they do occur frequently. When they happen the disciple maker can expect to see several groups starting and a significant openness by more people to engage in discovery groups.
\p I was recently in India touring various small village churches. I was told more than once that every place where there was a church in a predominately Hindu or Muslim village, it was because there was a very clear miracle in answer to prayer. Here in the U.S., one of the men we recently trained, in turn trained another leader who started a discovery group in Texas. The leader we trained was invited to Texas to visit his mentee’s group and prayed with a blind person who was then able to see. Within a few days there were four discovery groups going and now a church has developed. This is an example of miracle acceleration.
\p When miracles take place or questions arise, the disciple maker needs to be flexible to move to do some discovery studies that address the questions or manifestations of the Holy Spirit. It is the Holy Spirit who is at work. Our job is to assist Him in His work.
\p Once the people being reached have come to a fuller understanding of the power of the Holy Spirit or have their questions answered, return to the original study. The goal is to lay in a solid foundation. Forgiveness and miracles without a foundation of understanding will not keep a person living as a disciple of Jesus.
\li \bd The best time for a church to plant a church is when it ’ s very young\bd* – Why? There is an enthusiasm generated when the Holy Spirit begins forming a group of people into a church. People are excited and open to see what God is doing and there is a willingness to participate in what the Holy Spirit is doing; to try new things and to share them with others.
\p As the organization of a church solidifies, roles begin to be defined, equipment and sometimes a building is purchased and must be maintained. People become more preoccupied with the internal working of the church and the time available to reach out diminishes.
\p Generally, the first two years of a church’s existence is the most productive time to plant other churches. It is rare that a church more than five years old will plant another church. This is the normal maturing process of a church. What it means for the disciple maker or church planter, is that he needs to be aware and seize the opportunities that arise in the first months of a new church’s life to plant other churches.
\li \bd No mass evangelism so the masses will be saved\bd* – Billy Graham’s crusades produced hundreds of thousands of professions of faith, yet in spite of all the follow-up efforts only 2% to 4% of them could be found in a church a year later.
\p In my experience of working with street evangelists trying to reach people with the gospel, I discovered that our effectiveness of moving people from prayer and surrender to followers was less than one-tenth that of Billy Graham’s organization.
\p As David Watson described earlier, the work of five men in India who prayed and became disciples, and then found people of peace and mentored them over a few years has, after less than 20 years, produced more than 6 million new believers and disciples of Jesus who continue to double at about a five year rate. In sub-Saharan Africa, nine years of work has produced over one million new believers who are adding about 20% every year.
\p God is not a program. He is not a process (although He can use programs and processes.) Our God is a relational God. It is part of his DNA: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He sent his son who commissioned us with that same calling; to reconcile the world unto Him in relationship. Jesus for his part handed this on to us (see 2 Corinthians 5:18 and John 17:25–26).
\li \bd Obedience is more important than knowledge –\bd* Knowledge in itself does not change us, but obedience forces a change in everything about a person. Knowledge itself will “puff up” (1 Corinthians 8:1) rather than build up. As shown earlier, the steps of “obedience” to the revelation of God are actually acts of repentance, a conscious decision to change direction of one’s life to conform to God’s desires. Repentance is the requirement to enter into the Kingdom of God. It is in the Kingdom of God that we have access to more of the knowledge of God’s purposes and ways and God himself. “\it He who loves me obeys my words and my father will love him and we will make our habitation in him.”\it* John 14:23
\li \bd Don ’ t focus on personal evange-lism; focus on reaching the whole community through families – the Person of Peace is the key\bd* – Again this can be a difficult change of mind-set for those who have experienced the adrenaline rush of praying with an individual to receive Jesus. Consider that in traditional conversion-focused evangelism, the act of a person receiving Jesus as savior and lord, begins to separate them from their social community. Very quickly they become an “outsider” to their family and friends. Furthermore, the new believer or convert is not equipped to guide them into a long-term relationship with Jesus that he himself doesn’t have.
\p What happens when it is obvious that the Holy Spirit is at work in a person’s life and he or she wants to surrender his life to Jesus? Since we are co-laborers with the Holy Spirit then our job is to cooperate with the Holy Spirit. So, yes, if that is the person’s desire, then pray with them, but also immediately invite the person to lead his friends and family in a discovery study. Start mentoring them into a role of “laborer in the harvest” from the onset.
\p \bd Focus on ordinary people not professional Christians\bd* – If we are entering a different social culture, be aware that existing Christians in that culture, are to the non-believing members, people outside and usually unacceptable. Remember the professional Christian’s job “\it is to equip the saints for the work of ministry.”\it* (Ephesians 4:11-12). Additional reasons for this “counter-intuitive” were shown earlier.
\li \bd Buildings often kill church planting –\bd* As we have already mentioned, stewardship of physical assets consumes people’s time and effort. It is important to understand and accept that as a church grows the acquisition of buildings is a normal part of maturing in non-hostile environments. The presence of buildings can serve for training and equipping centers for DMM and give public credibility to a church, but the fact is that it may remove that church from direct church planting and move them to a supportive role.
\li \bd Expect the hardest places to yield the greatest results\bd* – Remember that we are in a spiritual battle. When the devil “digs in” and gets aggressive, consider that this is a strategic stronghold for him. A victory for the gospel in this area can open up many other opportunities. We attack the strongholds with much prayer, before we physically engage in the battle.
\p So, in practical terms, don’t equate “not being received” in Matthew and Luke 10 which we discussed in counter-intuitive 3, with confronting a “hard place.” Indifference is to be met with our departure. Hostility should be confronted with much prayer, seeking God, varieties of tactics, and persistence. Be encouraged when you encounter opposition.
\li \bd Leave early!\bd* Here is the last one. It is counter intuitive to all traditional missionary works. From the beginning, the disciple maker needs to be planning his exit. This was the mark of the early Apostles. It was effective then. In \it Poised for Harvest Braced for Backlash,\it* Timothy Millers writes
\p “\it Paul probably never knew exactly how long God would allow him to be physically present with a group of new disciples. The very nature of his ministry, therefore, necessitated a mode of foundation building that imparted to new believers something that would result in both their personal transformation and in the further advancement of the gospel, regardless of the disruptions and unpredictable circumstances, engendered by the release of power through him.”\it* (p18)
\p Again, recognize that it is Jesus who works through the Holy Spirit to build his church (Matthew 16:18). \bd Our goal is to establish a foundation of scripture, obedience, sharing, accountability and mentoring so that the Holy Spirit can replicate and multiply without our direct involvement.\bd*
\p This does not mean that the disciple maker abandons the work and relationships, but rather that he is not physically present. The relationship with your mentee who has become your coworker, continues either with electronic and telephone communications or occasional physical visits, most likely in a remote location if we are working in a hostile environment.
\p This will be your third discovery group study. Take some time to watch Part four of video 5: First Century Discipleship, by Ed Gross. In your discovery group meeting review what you have learned so far and then complete the discovery process focusing on John 1:35-46 and Matthew 23:8-11. These two passages define much of our role in the discipleship process. The first role of a disciple of Jesus is to bring people to Jesus and the second is to let Jesus be the rabbi as we support one another in the process. The latter is the basis for the rule that there is no teaching or preaching allowed in a discovery group.
\p As before, record individual needs for prayer, group discoveries, personal and corporate “I/we will” statements and the names of people selected to share the passage with. Please remember that the people you would share these 15 passages with are believers that may be interested in joining you when you begin engaging those people who don’t have a relationship with Jesus. For engaging people who are not-yet believers use the “Discovering God” series in Appendix 2.
\p Take some time to evaluate how your discovery group is going and what are their some changes that you need to make. Is the facilitator doing a good job of asking questions to draw everyone into the sharing time? Are the members of the group following through on their “I will” statement? Are they consistently sharing what they have learned during the study time? Have you identified someone outside the group to reach out to? What can you change to be more effective? Good facilitation skills are essential for successful discovery groups (see Chapter 4)
\p Decide what changes you want to try and then make them during the next three meetings when you will have some opportunities to see how they work.
\p The next two chapters focus on prayer, but prayer starts with our orientation to living in the presence of God. We will therefore start with \bd Deuteronomy 6:1-15\bd* – Internal spiritual life
\p “Contagious Disciple Making”
\p Ch. 11. “Be a Disciple Who Makes Disciples.”
\b
\periph Chapter 7. Living Fully for God – The Shemah
\ms1 Chapter 7
\ms2 Living Fully for God – The Shemah
\p It was the fourth time that I was challenged to do a discovery study of Deuteronomy 6, “the Great Shemah,” that the word “disciple” moved from something I tried to make, to something I became. My first pass through Deuteronomy 6 was to see it as an illustration of how I could engage people in a way that would help me discover if God was at work in their lives. The expression used to explain this to me was “to be obviously spiritual without being religiously obnoxious.” The second time through it I saw it as a way to integrate family and outreach. The third time I looked at ways to interpret such things as “signs on your hands” and “frontlets on your forehead” in practical application.
\p But it was the fourth time when my mentor, Ricardo Pineda challenged me by asking me, “How will you obey each of the commands?”, that it moved to my heart. I realized why the “Shemah” is thought of as the core of Judaism and I saw that it was the core of a disciple’s life as well. As you do the discovery study on Deuteronomy I hope that it has a similar impact on your life.
\p David Watson in his book, \it Contagious Disciple Making\it*, writes concerning Deuteronomy 6:4-9:
\p “\it The passage opens with the Hebrew word Shemah, which can be translated as “hear,” “observe,” or “obey.” The intent of the word is for us to “hear and obey” the rest of this passage.\it*
\p \it We must understand that there is only one God and He is our Lord. And what follows helps us understand how we connect to Him. We must love Him with all our hearts and all our souls and all our strength.\it*
\p “Love the Lord your God . . . with all your heart.”\it The word “all” means all, and that’s what all it means! If you have reserved stuff in your heart for other things besides God, you’re not going to experience the depth in relationship you desire. . . .\it*
\p “\it We know we struggle. There are things we like to do that we know we should not. . . It’s in our hearts and we struggle with it. The longer we wrestle without the intent to conquer that battle, the less we experience God’s presence in our lives because we’ve reserved part of our hearts for something or someone else. All means all, and that’s all it means. Anything less and we miss what God has for us.\it*
\p “\it Love the Lord your God with . . . . all your soul” . . .So here’s the picture. . . . Love the Lord with that part of you that’s eternal. If you’ve invested in God for eternity, you’ll look at life differently. He says, “I want you to love Me with that part of you that’s eternal so you will know beyond a doubt that you are connected to Me.” It’s that forever connectedness at the soul level that gets you through disaster points in your life that you don’t think you can live through. If you haven’t been through any of those yet, just wait awhile and they will catch up to you. If your love for God does not connect at the soul level, then when you hit the wall of disaster in your life, you won’t have anything to take you through it. Then suddenly it’s God’s fault; He’s doing this to me,” and you start asking all kinds of questions about who God is and what His place is in your life. Pp. 69-70\it*
\p The intent of this discovery study is that God’s word will penetrate to the depths of who you are individually and in your relationships in your discovery group. As you study, memorize, obey, and share the passage you learn by memory in your own words, you will find that God’s word is engraved on your heart and that your desire will be to teach your children and grandchildren. If it takes hold of you, you will find yourself speaking about God and his words in your home. When you walk along the way and meet people and talk to them, your conversations will turn to what God is doing in your heart, not with “religious” words, but in the expression of his actions in your life in everyday language.
\p Making “discovery Bible studies” part of your life is one very practical way of living out the Shemah. When you and the members of your household are studying a scripture passage together, the conversations often move into talking about God.
\p So where do you find time to do discovery studies, prayer times, and times to outreach? Everyone has lives filled with activities, some can obviously be discarded, but others are more difficult. I personally use to read through the Bible every year. I now have replaced this overview reading with ongoing discovery studies. Both my wife Cindy and I have made them a regular part of our time with God.
\p That is what I have changed to implement the Shemah in my home. When I am about, maybe in a store or restaurant or meeting a neighbor, I have found that asking one or two of the first three questions a great way to start a conversation that can very quickly moves to a spiritual dimension. “What are you thankful for today” opens up all kinds of opportunities to talk about heartfelt thoughts. Sometimes asking what problems they are facing can begin a conversation that leads to a sharing of their lives and maybe an opportunity to pray or to talk about their faith or need for God. Having Bible stories worked into your heart and mind and ready to share, can be very handy when an occasion arises. There are many other ways to open spiritual conversations, but these all work best when they flow out of your everyday life and reflect a care for the person you are engaging in conversation.

\p One little saying that I try to keep in mind is, “before you go, be prepared. When you are there, be aware.” Being intentional in everything is part of following Jesus. He did not stumble through life, but lived \it intentionally\it* every minute of the 33 or so years that he was on the earth. The place to start as Paul said, is to “let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.” (Colossians 3:16) Living the “Shemah” starts with your own prayer and worship life. It needs to fill your home. Then it needs to affect what you do and how you prepare yourself every day.
\b
\p \it Prayer needs to grow out of who we are and our relationship with God.\it*
\b
\p This chapter will prepare us to study about prayer and to find “people of peace.” How many times have you heard exhortations to pray and how many times have you tried, but not made much progress. Like discipleship, prayer is not something you add to your life successfully. Prayer needs to grow out of who we are and our relationship with God. Likewise, finding “people of peace” hinges on us being disciples to whom Jesus wants to bring his workers. He has selected them to bring in the harvest, but they need to be trained by disciples who model and can point them to the one Rabbi who is fully worthy to follow. It is a common misconception to think that successful disciple making hinges on our efforts without recognizing that we are fully in partnership with Jesus and the Holy Spirit. \bd Jesus is not looking for good intentions, he is looking for disciples who live in obedience to this word and his Spirit.\bd* As you begin to live Deuteronomy 6, you will find that your prayer life begins to deepen and Jesus will bring people of peace into your path and the two are connected.
\p Start this session by watching Conclusion of “First Century Discipleship” by Ed Gross. As before, record individual needs for prayer, group discoveries, personal and corporate “I/we will” statements and the names of people selected to share the passage with. Please remember that the people you would share these passages with are believers that may be interested in joining you when you begin engaging those people who don’t have a relationship with Jesus.
\p Dig into ways that you can obey this passage
\p During the discovery study explore at some depth what it might mean to apply each part of the passage to your life and the life of your family. I would recommend a verse-by-verse, phrase-by-phrase study and obedience applications. (see Appendix 3.)
\p \bd Consistently Obedient Lives?\bd* Consistency is an important part of being a disciple. As you read the stories of the lives of the twelve who followed Jesus, you see that it is not easy. We, however, have the advantage of not only having the Holy Spirit with us, but also \bd in\bd* us. (John 14:17) Once the Holy Spirit was given at Pentecost, you can see that there was much more consistency in the lives of the disciples. Take a few minutes to discuss this as a group. Is there something practical that you can do to be more consistent in your relationship with Jesus?
\p \bd What is your experience with the Holy Spirit?\bd* How do you see the Holy Spirit manifest himself in your life? Discuss this in your group. If anyone needs a greater infilling of the Holy Spirit, take some time and pray for one another. We have learned that He is our teacher. The work of becoming a disciple and making a disciple requires the active participation of the Holy Spirit.
\p \bd Conspicuous Spiritual Expressions?\bd* Take some time to discuss how you might begin to “speak of these things as you walk along the roads” of life. (Deuteronomy 6:7) Remember, these are not merely expressions you utter, but must flow out of a desire to get to know the person you are addressing. Your immediate purpose is to open them to responding to you as the Holy Spirit opens their heart to you. Their response may not be totally open initially, but if there seems to be a heart connection continue to follow up with them. We will learn more about this in the chapter on finding people of peace.
\p In addition to asking the simple questions you regularly use in the introduction of the discovery process, here are some questions and pointers developed by a friend who is a member of Pioneer Missions:
\p 1. “Could I pray for you right now?”
\p 2. If someone asks you: “How are you?” You might respond with: “I am better than I deserve. …” (This could open a door to discuss grace vs. deserved condemnation)
\p 3. Rephrase traditional religious phrases to inject new meaning or catch attention whereas the rote phrases might just pass over.
\p 4. Learn to express gratitude beyond a simple ‘thank you’. Try to make a connection with the person in the way you thank them for a service, etc.
\p 5. In general conversation: commenting that something (that they have mentioned) is a blessing from God.
\p 6. In longer conversations when complaints and problems are mentioned: Asking why they think bad things happen, moving toward asking if they’ve ever read the story in the Bible (Genesis through Deuteronomy) about how sin came into the world.
\p 7. When you meet someone new say, “The kingdom of God is near.”
\p 8. "You are not smiling today, what is happening with you?"
\p 9. "You look sad today. Do you have a problem?" Of course, everyone has a problem.
\p 10. I believe children are a gift (or blessing) from God.
\p 11. God is providing everything we need.
\p 12. May God bless you and your family.
\p 13. May the peace (grace, blessing, joy, love) of the Lord Jesus be with you and your family.
\p 14. I’m thankful that God arranged for us to meet today.
\p 15. I believe God not only loves you, but also wants to bless you and your family.
\p 16. I love God because He loved me first.
\p 17. Can I tell you an interesting Bible story I read recently?
\p 18. I am a follower of Jesus, so I often pray for people I meet. Do you have something I can pray for you about?
\p 19. You sneeze and someone says. Bless you. You respond, “Thank you, he does!”
\p 20. When someone wrongs you, or makes a mistake then reply "If that's the worst thing that happens to me today, then it is a great day!" It's not overtly "God" oriented, but people are pleasantly shocked by the positive attitude. Then, the response can \bd be more God centric.\bd*
\p \bd Engagement Ministries?\bd* You may hear people refer to engagement as “access ministries.” That only describes the first part of engagement. Getting inside community is the first step, but building the relationships opens doors to begin finding people of peace. In the entire process of making disciples in a new culture or with a new group of people, engagement takes the greatest amount of time and effort.
\p Discuss how are you are currently engaged with the community you are trying to reach. What additional things can you and your group can do to increase the level of engagement? Are there any organizations who have already engaged the group of people? Try to leverage existing opportunities. Look to God to direct you in this area.
\p The next two chapters will be on prayer and then on finding a person of peace. We will start with \bd Luke 11:1-13\bd* – Focusing and persisting in prayer
\p Discuss with your family or those who live with, how you can begin to incorporate the discovery process in your life together. Try engaging people you meet by asking them what they are thankful for or some other question to engage them at a deeper interpersonal level.
\p “\it Miraculous Movements”\it* by Jerry Trousdale, Ch. 3. “Pray the Lord of the Harvest”
\periph Chapter 8. Engaging God in Prayer
\ms1 Chapter 8
\ms2 Engaging God in Prayer
\p In the last chapter we tried to establish the foundation of effective prayer; a life lived fully for God. Prayer for a disciple involves making yourself available for God to use to fulfill your prayer. Like everything about discipleship, it is active and not passive.
\b
\p \it For a disciple, prayer is active. It means asking for God’s will to be done and making yourself available to accomplish it.\it*
\b
\p Jerry Trousdale writes
\p “\it A dramatic revival is taking place worldwide, as thousands upon thousands of Muslims are moving from the enslavement of hopeless legalism to embrace the only means of salvation and eternal life, available as a free gift through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The question that many ask is, why is this happening now? Why and how are entire mosques of Muslims becoming followers of Christ? The final answer, of course, is this: God has chosen to do so at this time. But on a human level, there is one constant theme that keeps coming up in the interviews we have conducted with Christ followers from a Muslim background: abundant prayer.\it*
\p \it Prayer is the greatest weapon that any disciple maker can wield, and God’s people are using it effectively around the world at this very minute. Prayer takes the spiritual battle out of the human realm and puts it fully into God’s hands, and not even the powers of hell itself can stand against His mighty Spirit. It is prayer that has opened the doors of mosques, torn down the walls of bigotry, and broken the weapons of hatred. When God’s people kneel in prayer, God’s will is done on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10).\it* (\it Miraculous Movements (MM)\it* pp. 52-53)
\p Earlier we read about successful disciple makers in India praying regularly and for long periods of time. Here are some of the characteristics that Jerry Trousdale describes of the disciple makers in Africa:
\li Weekly fasts
\li Regular six-hour to all night prayer vigils
\li Midday prayers by church members and ministry teams
\li Personal early morning prayer for one to three hours
\li Family devotions based on discovery Bible studies and prayer.
\li Early and ongoing training in prayer for both those in the process of discovering God and new believers.
\p Jerry writes:
\p “\it When Muslims discover that God welcomes the prayers of our hearts and answers them, their spirits begin to rejoice. The former disciplines of forced Islamic fasting and rote repetitions of the same prayer seventeen times a day are willingly left behind as people discover the freedom to pray as God leads them. This happens even before they fully understand Jesus, in part because they see their mentors in the gospel living lives of much prayer themselves.”\it* (\it MM\it*, p. 56)
\p Our personal prayer is only a part of the prayer that is needed to launch and sustain disciple making movements.
\p David Watson writes:
\p “\it As we started looking at Disciple-Making Movements worldwide, we made a critical observation: A prayer movement precedes every Disciple-Making Movement. There are two sides to catalyzing a prayer movement. First, we must become people of prayer. Second, we need to mobilize people to pray\it*.” (\it Contagious Disciple Making,\it* p. 79).
\p Learning how to establish a full prayer network is both beyond the scope of this book and my personal experience, although it is one of the areas I am actively engaged in developing. I do want to at least lay out a framework that I am seeking to implement and that other movements have identified as critical:
\ms4 PERSONAL PRAYER LIFE
\pc \bd Living and modeling a deep and broad personal prayer life\bd*.
\p My prayer life has increased from about half an hour of prayer a day to about an hour and a half. You will notice that is still a fraction of the prayer lives of people who have seen great movements start and grow. I am confident that as the amount of prayer in my own personal life grows and the amount of corporate prayer expands, we will begin to see great breakthroughs in North America.
\li I currently intercede for about an hour every day for the communities for which I have accepted responsibility. (We will talk more about communities a little later.) I try to maintain regular communications with individuals in each of these communities.
\li I spend a few minutes daily talking to God. This is the dialogue that we will talk about next.
\li I also work on my discovery studies and discuss them regularly with my wife. This is a core part of my time with God.
\li Another characteristic that has become part of my life is that I pray immediately whenever I learn of a need. I discovered years ago, that when I am talking with someone and the Holy Spirit has opened that person’s heart to share, if I will pray right then, I have clear access to the Holy Spirit to guide my prayers. So, I pray with power and understanding. Then when I am home, the prayer request has become part of me and I continue to pray.
\li My newest undertaking is to ask one person a day what their needs are and pray for him or her.
\p My own experience matches that of David Watson when he writes:
\p “\it Here is something I’ve learned: knowledge transfer is not intimacy. It’s part of intimacy, but if all communication comes in the forms of texts and lists, intimacy soon disappears.\it*
\p “\it We’ve been trained to talk to God by reading Him our lists rather than having conversation. We mutter hasty sentence prayers as we race through our day without stopping and listening to what God has to say.”\it* (\it CDM, p. 80)\it*
\p In my own daily prayer life I try to take a few minutes every morning to write down both what God says to me and my responses and questions that I would like him to answer. I have been doing this for many years. God’s and my conversations have grown in depth over the years.
\p Your can start by writing down a question that you have and ask God for an answer. Don’t come with expectations, but be ready to write down whatever comes to mind. It may be scripture, or it may be a sentence or a phrase. If you feel like writing about your love for God or some struggle you are enduring, pour out your heart.
\p If you don’t like to write, then take some time to talk to God verbally. You need to recharge your relationship with God daily.
\p Where will you find the time? I remember facing that question as a young man. I had a young family, a full-time job, and a Christian life that easily added another 40 hours a week. My personal time with God had dwindled to almost nothing.
\p I had been given the job of reaching out to a Christian leader who lived in the country near another city, to guide and support him. He was a farmer and my wife Cindy and I were visiting him. Our two little children were with us.
\p After breakfast, the son of our host offered to take me flying. I had just recently gotten out of the Air Force and had worked as a flight instructor for a few months before moving to join a larger Christian fellowship in a major city.
\p Once we were airborne we went over to another farm to do some practice landings. We wound up crashing in a cornfield.
\p When we took off from the first touch-and-go landing, the engine quit. As I was sitting in a suddenly totally quiet plane with a full load of fuel and about to crash, I was thinking to myself that we would both be killed. I remember asking myself, “Will this hurt?” and answering it, “Guess I will find out.” Next, I asked God where he was. There was no answer. So, there I was, at the point of probable death and I was not in God’s presence. I had gotten so busy doing things for God, that I had let my relationship with him slip away. It was not the place I wanted to be when I died; having to wonder if my “profession of faith” would get me into heaven. It was not a good feeling.
\p After I recovered from the crash, both physically and psychologically, I did some deep soul searching. What would it mean to have done great things for God and lost my loving relationship with him. God can get by without my work for him, but I can not get by without a daily time of telling him how much I love him.
\p So, finding time to spend with God became my top priority. I hope that it becomes yours as well. Once it does you will find ways to carve out time in the morning at home, at work, when you are traveling, to quit doing some of the “good things” in your life to make time for the most important thing you can do, to regularly spend time and talk to the God you love.
\ms4 COMMUNITY ACTION AND PRAYER PLAN
\pc Developed by Andrew and Heather Hocking
\p The second part of the framework of personal prayer is to develop a\bd Community Action and Prayer Plan\bd*. The purpose of developing this plan is to direct your engagement both in prayer and physically with the group of people God has given you to reach. When we began this journey together in this book you were asked to select a few potential groups to reach and to identify people who can help you reach those groups of people. Your list should have included both those outside the community who have an interest, and those inside the community who may provide access to the community.
\b
\p There are eight areas to evaluate in the Prayer Plan (see appendix 4)
\li 1. \bd What community are you praying for?\bd* Defining a community may be simple or complex, but it must be concise. Communities can be exotic or the ones you are part of. Some of mine include: the people in Andhra Pradesh, India; my unsaved siblings; the neighbors around my church; the people living just north of Jinja in Uganda; and the community of coworkers in my city. These are communities in which I have access and for which I pray. I can pray for more communities than I can engage at the same time. Over time I hope to engage them all and find the people that God is calling to be his disciples.
\li 2. \bd What is God doing with them?\bd* Spiritual and physical recognizance – You need to know the community you are seeking to reach and pray for. That definitely means some physical recognizance. What are their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs? Prayer walking, researching the history, talking to the people who have contact with them such as: social workers, teachers, neighbors, store owners, family members, coworkers.
\pi Once you determine some of the things, write them down in your community plan. This will allow you to focus your prayers and begin to plan ways to engage them.
\li 3. \bd Who will join you as partners in reaching them?\bd* – Some of the names of people you wrote earlier will go in here. (see figure 2.1) This can also include ministries and social services that are connected to the people you want to reach and are willing to partner with you in reaching them. You can write down some information about each of them, to help you pray for them and to understand how you can build partnerships.
\li 4. \bd God’s guidance to reach this community of people (Vision)\bd* This can include direct words from God or scripture passages. It can be advice from other people. Whatever you receive, try to put it into sentences that are clear and give enough vision to help establish a strategy to accomplish it.
\li 5. \bd Who do you know in the community?\bd* This is a growing list of names and biographical information; where do they live? What are their needs? What do they do? Who are they connected to? What are their personal needs?
\li 6. \bd Who are the potential persons of peace?\bd* Out of the list of people you get to know, who seems to respond positively to you? Who are their contacts? What influence do they have?
\li 7. \bd What barriers are there?\bd* (Requires recognizance)* What are the political, economic, relational, and spiritual barriers that the community has? These are both opportunities and hindrances.
\li 8. \bd What other communities can this group contact?\bd* It is important that we keep looking ahead. What other communities are the people who we are trying to reach able to reach out to beyond the one they are in?
\p Take some time to write out community prayer guides for each of the communities you are reaching out to. These guides should allow space for adding people and information. Once you have assembled guides for each community, you can begin to pray addressing each of the areas. It will allow you to pray with greater understanding and focus.
\p These prayer guides can also be useful to develop plans to reach the community. Engagement ministries are usually focused on the physical needs you should have identified. If there are ministries meeting those needs, then you can work to build relationships with them, or join their work.
\p This acrostic has been used by many ministries. It is intended to give structure to personal prayer.
\p \bd A\bd*doration – of God and for what he is doing
\p \bd C\bd*onfession and alignment with God’s purposes
\p \bd T\bd*hanksgiving – for partners and successes
\p \bd S\bd*upplication and \bd S\bd*piritual Warfare– For needs and resources, Spiritual strongholds, and Protection
\p As you look at the Lord’s prayer in Luke 11, be aware that this is more than a prayer that Jesus gave us. It also provides a format for private and corporate worship:
\b
\p “\it Father, hallowed be your name.\it*
\p Worship and adoration
\p \it Your kingdom come.\it*
\li Invitation and intercession (community prayer plans)
\p \v 3 \it Give us each day our daily bread,\it*
\li Supplication (personal finances, health, co-laborers, understanding)
\p \v 4 \it and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us.\it*
\li Repentance and forgiveness
\p \it And lead us not into temptation.”\it*
\li Deliverance and Guidance
\p As we briefly discussed in the section on counter-intuitives in Chapter 6, we want to invest our time in people who are both faithful and empowered with the Holy Spirit to do greater things than we are. Regularly take a few minutes to ask God to prepare you and to bring you to those individuals who will have the greatest impact for the kingdom of God.
\b
\p There are many parts of scripture that include wonderful Spirit filled prayer, the Psalms in particular and several of Paul’s Epistles. To utilize these passages in your prayer, change the third person “he” to “you” and insert the name of the people you are praying for in place of the third person, “they” or the second person “you.” There are a few examples in Appendix 4:
\b
\p It is simplistic to say that prayer is important and even critical. Yet there is no movement where there has not been a corresponding prayer movement. In our Western culture, it is relatively easy to get people to “do things for God.” The block to widespread movements in North America has been the lack of individual and corporate prayer.
\b
\p As you become a disciple of Jesus with a small group of others, be that a group of friends or family members, this can become your first level of corporate prayer. These are the people with whom you share a common journey. You are already praying for their needs. This group should also become intercessors praying for God’s kingdom to come and that his kingdom would be accomplished by the planting and growth of “Disciple Making Movements.”
\b
\p The next level of corporate prayer could be your ministry partners. Introducing your prayer plan to them and getting their input into it, can provide deeper substance to your prayer together. If they will carry the prayers for the chosen community to their intimate social relationships, you will begin forming a network of some size.
\b
\p The third level of corporate prayer would be to inform and engage prayer groups in churches and existing intercessor ministries. There is a growing movement of “houses of prayer” and intercession ministries around the United States, which if they could engage the vision of disciple making movements, could provide another level of prayer and intercession.
\b
\p I have participated in a group of intercessors for the 10/40 Window for a few years now. Intercessory prayer for this area has been going on for decades. As we look at all of the movements occurring in this area, the connection with ongoing intercessory prayer is hard to miss. What would happen if we begin this level of intercession for North America and Europe?
\p Watch video 9 “Prayer” by Jerry Trousdale.
\b
\p With your discipleship discovery group complete the group process. For the scripture study do an oral study of Luke 11:5-10. (See Chapter 3.)
\p Change facilitators in your training group so that each person has an opportunity to facilitate. At the conclusion of your time together, evaluate how the facilitator did in maintaining order, involving everyone in the sharing time, and drawing out the important discovery points in the passage.
\p In addition to the standard discovery questions about God and man, what do you discover about prayer and the work of the Holy Spirit in this passage?
\li What are some successes of your own prayers?
\b
\li Where can you find more time to pray?
\b
\li What can you do to better focus your prayers?
\b
\li Who can you invite to pray for Disciple Making Movements to begin where you are?
\b
\p The next chapter will be on finding a person of peace. Do written studies on each of \bd Matthew 9:35-10:16\bd* and \bd Acts 16:25-34.\bd* The Matthew 9-10 passage describes the mission of the twelve to reach and possible recruit others to become disciples. There are a few distinctions between their assignment and that of the other 72 (70) which are worthwhile noting.
\p The second passage is to help you identify the characteristics of People of Peace. There are many examples of people of peace: Lydia, Samaritan woman at the well, Cornelius, Zacchaeus, even Andrew and Philip, and the thief on the cross demonstrate traits of a person of peace. There are also stories in the Old Testament, Rahab, who hid the Israeli spies and the widow from Zarephath near Sidon are examples. From these we can begin to identify characteristics of a person of peace as well as the role that we are to play as a disciple maker.
\p We will be looking at this passage in parallel with Luke 10:1-11 to discover some of the responsibilities of the Disciple maker.
\p With your discovery group discuss one of your community prayer plans and lead them in praying through each of the eight parts.
\p “\it Miraculous Movements\it*” by Jerry Trousdale – Ch. 3. “Pray the Lord of the Harvest”
\p “\it Contagious Disciple Making”\it* by David Watson and Paul Watson – Ch. 14 “Finding a Person of Peace”
\periph Chapter 9. Finding a Person of Peace
\ms1 Chapter 9
\ms2 Finding a Person of Peace
\ms4 Question: What is a Person of Peace?
\p In this chapter we will discover some of the characteristics of a person of peace in Acts 16:13-21. We will also look at what a disciple maker might do so that you will understand your role and responsibility in the discovery process.
\p In summary, finding people of peace is the first job of a disciple maker. If there is no person of peace there is no disciple making.
\p No story better illustrates how serious God is about preparing people to receive the invitation to become disciples of Jesus, than the one David Watson tells in \it Perspectives on the World Christian Movement\it*: ”A Movement of God Among the Bhojpuri of North India,”
\p \it An old man sat on the edge of the road approaching the village. When he saw me (David), he started. He slowly stood up and came to meet me.\it*
\p “\it Finally!” He exclaimed. “You are finally here.” Before I could say anything he took my arm and pulled me into the village.\it*
\p “\it Here is the man I told you about,” he told people as he pulled me along. “Here is the man I dreamed about every night for the last twenty years. My dreams told me that we must listen to everything this man tells us.”\it* (p.699)
\p My own stories are not so dramatic, but I have had one young man walk up to me in Uganda and another a month later in the United States, who God had prepared to hear the good news. In the latter case, this young man who was a waiter in a restaurant, overheard me talking about making disciples to some friends and moved closer and closer.
\p When I talked with him, he said
\p “\it I had a dream a few weeks ago where God told me that my house was going to be raided by the police. I told my buddies, but they convinced me that is was just a dream. However, my cousin got me to leave the house that night and sure enough, the police raided it and they all wound up in jail on drug possession charges. I knew that I needed to change what I was doing, but I didn’t know how. Then this morning a voice told me that I was going to meet someone who had the words I need to hear.”\it*
\p These stories are not the norm, but are not unusual. So, what are the characteristics of a person of peace? Both David Watson and my stories illustrate that God is at work in some people’s lives before we arrive on the scene. The old man in the village had waited for twenty years. My friend had waited for several weeks, until God could use us in their lives.
\p We live in a spiritual world that we for the most part cannot see. Experiences like David Watson and I have just presented are exciting and we can know that they are from God, both because they extend the kingdom of God and because they conform to stories in the Bible.
\p I like to encourage believers to be spiritual risk-takers, but to hang on tightly to the safety line of the Bible. The words of the Bible are tested. With the empowerment of the Holy Spirit they both provide life and protection.
\p Complete the five part discovery process with you group. In addition to the standard questions, take some time to compare the differences between the mission of the Twelve here and the Seventy two in Luke 10:1-11 that you studied earlier. .
\ms4 Characteristics of a Person of Peace and Role of the Disciple Maker
\iq1 \bd Matthew 10:5-16\bd* \v 5 These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, “Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, \v 6 but go rather to the \em lost sheep of the house of Israel\em*. \v 7 And proclaim as you go, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ \v 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. \v 9 Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts, \v 10 no bag for your journey, or two tunics or sandals or a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. \v 11 And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart. \v 12 As you enter the house, greet it. \v 13 And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. \v 14 And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. \v 15 Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town.
\p \v 16 “Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
\iq1 \bd Luke 10:2-7\bd* \p \v 2 And he said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. \v 3 Go your way; behold, I am sending you out \em as lambs in the midst of wolves\em*. \v 4 Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road. \v 5 Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house!’ \v 6 And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you. \v 7 And remain in the same house, \em eating and drinking what they provide\em*, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house. \p Both the 12 who were sent out first and the 72 that were sent out later had similar missions, but the target group of each was different. The Twelve were sent to the observant Jews, kosher Jews, whose food was “clean”. The 72 went to a more diverse group of people. Some of them were not keeping kosher kitchens, which would have been reason for Jesus to warn them about being sheep among wolves and to tell them twice to eat what was set before them.
\p The fruit of the mission of the 12 may well have been that the additional 72 disciples were added to the number, who in turn could be sent out to reach more people. Multiplication is the goal of every step of the disciple making process.
\b
\p As we think about to whom we should reach out, one of the key things that we can do is to multiply the number of people who are equipped as disciples to reach the lost. It may delay our reaching lost people, but if we engage more “believers” and invite them to “come and see” what it means to be a disciple of Jesus, we will multiply the number of disciple makers rapidly at the beginning.
\p Jesus was not only looking toward a multiplication of disciples and disciple makers. He had a genuine interest in seeing these “lost sheep” fully enter the kingdom of God.
\p \it Without experience, all truth lies in the realm of doubt and therefore eludes us.\it*
\b
\p Likewise, reaching people within the fold of the church is important in itself. The church is experiencing attack from without and within. Without experience, all truth lies in the realm of doubt and therefore is only as secure as the most appealing argument. Discipleship moves the truths of the Bible into the realm of experience for those who practice it.
\p A church full of people who, like the Bereans, search the scriptures and moreover apply it to their lives and are not afraid to ask preacher or pastor, “Where does it say that in the Bible,” will not be easily subverted. Neither will they be easily moved by attacks and deceptions outside the church.
\p So, Biblically oriented, obedience based and experiential discipleship is both the best defensive and the most effective offensive weapon by which the church can withstand attack and overcome even the gates of Hell.
\p Like the 72, once we engage the lost, we must be prepared to handle cultural differences with the people we are sent to reach, even when those differences are unacceptable to our religious training. We will talk more about this in the chapter on crossing cultural frontiers. Review the characteristics of the people of peace in the chart below.
\ms4 A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF FINDING THE PERSON OF PEACE Read LUKE 10:1-11, AND MATTHEW 10:5-14
\ms4 (LUKE 10: MATTHEW 10)
\ms4 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PERSON OF PEACE
\p Luke 10:5
\li Opens his/her door to you
\li Receives your blessing and shows interest
\p Luke 10:6
\li Opens his/her house to you/hospitable
\p Luke 10:7
\li Offers to sustain you in some way
\li He/she is worthy
\p Matthew 10:13
\li Has influence in his home/community
\li Receives you
\p Matthew 10:14
\li Hears your words
\p Though the target group was different, the process that was used by the 12 and the 72 was the same, they were to find people of peace. Let’s look at some of the characteristics of these people in these two passages. When we look at these two passages, we see some common characteristics of people of peace. They are open, hospitable, and generous. They are established in their social network. Most important God has been at work in their lives, so that they want to hear what you have to say to them.
\p There are many examples of people of peace in the Bible. Some worthwhile examples are the Samaritan woman at the well in John 4, Cornelius in Acts 10, and Lydia in Acts 16:13-15. The calling of the disciples that you studied in John 1:35-5, even Rahab, Ruth, Moses, and Abram in the Old Testament are other examples of people of peace. In your next discovery study you will look at the Ephesian jailer. In all of these stories you will see different characteristics. There are many that are unique to the particular individual and a few that are common to all. The key in this is that the Holy Spirit has been working in that person’s life so that they have a positive response to the message and they have a willingness and ability to share it with at least a few other people.
\p If they are unwilling or unable to share what they learn, they are not a person of peace. It is possible that they will lead or introduce you to someone else in the community who will fill the role of the facilitator. Once it is clear that there is nothing they will do to reach out, it is time to look for other people of peace.
\p It can be difficult to move on from a friendship that you have formed. While it is possible to keep some ongoing relationship, you know that you only have so much time to invest. If the call is to make disciples who in turn fulfill the great commission, then you need to make the decision to continue to invest in the relationship or to ask God to direct you to another person. This decision is easier to make earlier than later.
\p I know a couple who have invested several years into a relationship with a Muslim family. They have become like extended family, but they are not open to pursuing the God of the Bible.
\p Recall that before Jesus sent out the twelve disciples (Matthew 9:35-38) and the 72 (Luke 10:2) he instructed the disciples to pray the Lord of the harvest to send workers. Whether it was you or someone else who prayed, this person of peace is there as the result of a prayer that has released the Holy Spirit to begin a work in that person in preparation for your part in the discipleship process.
\p Finding a person of peace is not like hunting or fishing. God is working in the lives of many people. The scarcity is not people of peace, but in capable disciple makers. Let us look at our role in the following passages.

\ms4 Nine Characteristics of a Disciple Maker
\b
\p Here are some of the practical things that characterize successful disciple makers:
\li He will \bd l ove the Lord\bd* with all his heart, mind, soul and strength. In other words, successful disciple makers are living out the Shemah of Deuteronomy 6.
\b
\li A successful disciple maker \bd loves people\bd* as much as him/herself. It takes work and there is a cost to becoming a disciple maker. If the people you will be giving your life for are precious to you, then instead of tiring, you will be invigorated.
\b
\li He has a\bd life of deep and growing prayer.\bd* As discussed in the previous chapter, prayer precedes and undergirds everything.
\b
\li A disciple maker’s life is one of \bd obedience and learning\bd*. Not only is he a disciple who learns from the Bible on a regular basis, but he is aware of what God is doing around him. Every encounter with a person is an opportunity to learn.
\b
\li Disciple makers are characterized by lives of \bd deep humility\bd*. Many people mistakenly think that humility implies being self-demeaning and of a lowly attitude. Jesus is frequently referred to as being humble, but he certainly was neither of these things.
\b
\p \it Humility does not mean thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less and others more.\it*
\b
\p When you study the life of Jesus you see that humility does not mean thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less and others more. Jesus surrendered all he had because he loved us enough to do that. He was powerful in addressing hypocrisy and merciful to the lowly. He thought only of his Father in heaven and the people he came to rescue.
\b
\li A disciple maker’s life is one of \bd faith and patience\bd*. They go hand in hand. Faith is one of the few key words with a Biblical definition. It is “the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” (Hebrews 11:1 ESV) It is the things hoped for which are not seen that warrant our faith. Faith in faith is an illusion. Faith in Jesus and his kingdom has substance. Once a person has \it that\it* kind of faith, it is easy to have patience.
\b
\p \it Faith in faith is an illusion. Faith in Jesus and his kingdom has substance.\it*
\b
\p We are working for an eternal king in an eternal kingdom. His purposes will be accomplished and his timing is perfect. He was working in the world before we were born or born again. He has given us a small, but essential part of what to be done to fulfill the Great Commission.
\b
\li You will find that a disciple maker lives a \bd life of sacrifice\bd*. By this I mean willingness to pay whatever price is necessary to accomplish what God has given you to do. Disciples do not look for opportunities to sacrifice. They look for opportunities to obey and do what Jesus wants them to do. Having a loving relationship with Jesus makes the cost they have to pay worthwhile.
\b
\p \it Disciples do not look for opportunities to sacrifice. They look for opportunities to obey and do what Jesus wants them to do.\it*
\b
\p Being a disciple maker will likely lead you into spiritual and natural conflicts. Be gentle with your opponents. Recall that Saul of Tarsus began his journey to building the church, by persecuting it. Recall also, that it was not by persuasive words of men, but by an encounter with Jesus that the course of his life was redirected. “Pray the Lord of the harvest to send more workers.”
\b
\li The successful disciple maker will be \bd willing to work\bd* to evangelize the lost, gather the saved, develop a local church, train local leadership and move on as soon as possible. Let me stress the part about “moving on as soon as possible.” Our role is to introduce people to Jesus and to work in partnership with the Holy Spirit. It is Jesus who makes the disciples. The role of a disciple maker is a small part of the process, but it is absolutely critical and it is needed in many places. The Great Commission is not a call to build a place of residence, but a call to go and make disciples. Paul’s story is a good example. Once a church was planted he moved on, but he maintained a relationship with the people in each of the places he started a work.
\b
\li The last characteristic in our list is that a disciple maker has great joy in \bd giving all the glory to God\bd*. If you need the recognition and praise of people more than you want to glorify God, you will not last long as a disciple maker. I can speak for myself in this. There is nothing more that I want than that Jesus and our Father are glorified and that his kingdom will increase. There is nothing that gives me greater joy than the knowledge that I have a part in fulfilling the Great Commission; that what I do will produce eternal fruit.
\p When I think giving all glory to God, I often think of my relationship with my father. He was a child of the depression who grew up in the Appalachian coal country of West Virginia. He was hard working, hard driving, “no-nonsense” man. He was hard and unbending, but I loved him and respected him, because I was his son and because other men respected him.
\b
\p From the time I was five years old, on many Saturdays, he would take me with him to his work, which meant I spent many Saturdays on highway construction projects, mine excavation projects, and dam construction projects. The rule of thumb for this type of construction was that for every million dollars, one man would lose his life. I met several men who died in construction related accidents. The attitude of all of these men was “that is why we earn the big-bucks.”
\b
\p As soon as I was able at age 16, my father put me to work first as a “rodman” on a four-man survey crew, and then as a “miner” on a shafting crew when I was 18, he sent me off to Alaska when I was 19, Vietnam when I was 20, and the Netherlands when I was 21.
\b
\p He was testing and developing me to follow in his footsteps. I was honoured that he entrusted me with these opportunities and responsibilities. I was also aware that my performance reflected on him. Approval from my father did not come with words of praise, but with opportunities to take on more difficult tasks.
\b
\p During my last year in college when I was visiting him on one of our vacations, he took me down to his office and introduced me to all of his colleagues; by this time he was an executive vice president of one of the four largest construction companies in the world. “I want to introduce you to my son Jim.” There could be no greater words of praise and appreciation that I could receive.
\b
\p So, for me giving all glory to God is similar to my attitude toward working for my father and his company. Every action I take; every success and failure, reflects on my heavenly father and upon Jesus my Lord. My natural father had his share of personal faults and failures, but our heavenly father is perfect.
\b
\p I was not working for the final “This is my son” acknowledgement. It was sufficient for me, that the men I worked with could look at me and say, this young man is a credit to his father and I can respect his father, because I respect his son. I was honoured to be my father’s son and be entrusted with part of his life-time’s work. To have the great opportunity to be a disciple of Jesus and to offer this opportunity to others is the greatest pleasure of my life.
\b
\p Now looking at this list of nine characteristics of a disciple maker, if you are thinking, “how will I do this?” my character is not that strong in all of these areas; the task is overwhelming. Here is the beauty and power of being a disciple of Jesus. Once you are in relationship with Jesus as his disciple, your nature begins to change and all of these things begin to take place. Daily obedience to the words of God allows the Holy Spirit to transform you by renewing your mind.
\b
\p \bd Grace\bd*\it is the presence and power of God working in and through us to accomplish his purposes, for his glory.\it*
\b
\p When you start reading, discovering, and allowing the Holy Spirit to engage you with God’s word; when you begin to say, “I will respond to what the Holy Spirit has shown me in the Bible by doing . . .” then changes will take place in your life. Your priorities and desires will change. These nine characteristic are not something you strive to attain. They are characteristics of someone on a journey with God. It is the grace of God, which is the presence and power of God working in you and through you to accomplish what He wants, for His glory, that will develop these characteristics into your life. (John 14:16-17, 23)
\b
\p We have looked at some of the scripture references and at nine characteristics of a disciple maker. Let’s not lose sight of the forest for the trees. We have come to make disciples in order to complete the work which Jesus came to do; to reconcile the peoples of the world to his Father. It will not be complete in our life-time here on earth, but we have a part to play.
\li As disciples we need to fully live the “Shemah” in every part of our lives. This is what “feeds” our prayer and our own discipleship.
\li Keep in mind that Jesus via the Bible and the Holy Spirit do the discipling.
\li You invite people of peace to become disciples. This is not our project. It is the Holy Spirit’s work. We are to work with the people He selects. We do, however, have the privilege of asking the Father to send workers, so we have some say.
\li The person of peace is the worker in the field, therefore you need to determine what that person’s “field” or \it Oikos,\it* or social network is. This is part of building a relationship with him.
\li Your role is to train, coach, and mentor the people of peace to facilitate the discovery groups in his or her social network. As he grows and shows ability, your job is to train him as leader-disciple.
\li Jesus disciples them, you hold them accountable. The accountability is part of the relationship which grows into mutual accountability as they mature. Over time as you encourage them they grow from being mentees, to coworkers and friends – this is a long term friendship.
\b
\p The discovery series that we use to disciple people to Jesus follows the general format of the Bible. Look at how Jesus developed his disciples and try to duplicate that.
\li First – Build upon the foundation that Jesus used: the \bd Old Testament.\bd* It is not an accident of history that the Bible is laid out the way it is. The disciples that Jesus trained were well grounded in all of the Torah and prophets. We should lay in enough of this background so that when the people we are leading into a relationship with Him learn His “incarnate” story, they will have an understanding of the promises that God made and the processes He used to prepare the Jews for the arrival of their messiah.
\b
\li Second – Do what Jesus did, the way he did it. Use the \bd Gospels.\bd*The gospel accounts give us sufficient amounts of Jesus’ teaching to become his disciples. Most of the studies in this book are from the gospels. Remember, our Rabbi is Jesus, and he left us his written words and the Holy Spirit to complete the task.
\li Third – Once group members have all become baptized believers, it is normal for them to begin to take on characteristics of a simple church. Expect Jesus to use disciples to assist him as he establishes the church – here we use \bd Acts and Epistles\bd* as guidance. Just as the disciple maker assists Jesus and the Holy Spirit in making disciples rather than making them himself, we see in Matthew 16:18 that it is Jesus who builds the church, not disciples by themselves. Our role is to assist this process, not to direct it. As with the formation of disciples, directing new believers to scripture passages where the Holy Spirit can lead a discovery group, the basics of becoming a church will be learned.
\li Fourth,\bd Do everything in proper order\bd* – Expect the Holy Spirit and the Bible to do the teaching. Truths revealed by the Holy Spirit and discovered by people are fully owned by those who discover them.
\b
\p As disciples we should have aspirations to make disciples, but since disciple making is about relationships, our initial success will depend on our current set of relationships. This short exercise is meant to help you evaluate what type of relationships you are working with.
\b
\p Begin by listing in a notebook or a piece of paper, the top 20 closest current relationships in your life. Then mark:
\p \bd +\bd* beside those who are Christian
\p – beside those who are lost
\p \bd ?\bd* beside those you don’t know spiritual condition
\b
\p The next step is a simple evaluation. Count the number in each of the three categories: \bd +\bd*, \bd –\bd* and \bd ?\bd* marks.
\li High number of \bd +\bd*: You live in a Christian world. You can begin inviting believers to become disciples of Jesus. This was the first assignment of the Twelve. However, as you build a base of disciples, your eventual goal should be to reach beyond your enclave of believers and engage the lost people all around you.
\li High number of \bd –\bd*: You have access to the lost. You are positioned to immediately begin engaging lost people. Remember to make sure that you have a supportive team. Jesus sent the disciples out two-by-two. This is not meant to be a project for “lone ranger” disciples.
\li High number of ?: Start sharing some of the passages you have been learning with people and ask what they think about them. You will not only be on your way to find people of peace, but you will quickly find out what these people’s relationships are with God.
\b
\p Watch video 10, “People of Peace,” by Dave Hunt. Then complete the Discovery group process\bd .\bd* In addition to the basic three questions make a list of the characteristics of the person of peace and the characteristics of Disciple Makers. How would you apply these to your own life in terms of finding a person of peace and being a disciple maker?
\b
\p Lead your discovery group in praying for workers. Do the same passage(s) that you have just done. Write out: a general description of the person of peace / worker that God gives in prayer. With prayer partners ask to find the person of peace. Be prepared to be surprised when you go out.
\b
\p In the next chapter we will look at two different passages that give a basic outline of the two goals to make disciples and plant churches.
\li \bd Matthew 28:16-20\bd* – Our commission as disciples
\li \bd Matthew 16:13-21\bd* – Instructions for planting churches
\b
\p With your discovery group, begin to discuss potential people of peace who you have identified. With your deeper understanding of the characteristics of people of peace, review your community prayer guide to add or remove individual names. Discuss ways to begin engaging potential people of peace. Remember that, for non-believers, the “Discovering God” series starting with Genesis, provides the best passages to learn and share. The passages that you have been learning in this book are useful for engaging believers.

\periph Chapter 10. Starting a Discovery Group
\ms1 Chapter 10
\ms2 Starting a Discovery Group
\p Discovery Groups are both disciple making groups and they are the bridges to starting churches. Later in this chapter, you will be doing a group discovery on Matthew 28:16 – 20, the Great Commission, and Matthew 16:13-21. In Matthew 16, Jesus shows us that the church will be founded upon the bedrock of disciples. In context with what you have already learned, you and your discovery group hopefully will be able to develop your strategy and the tactics to reach the group you have selected. .
\p Your goal should be to either finish with a strong and growing discovery group or that you will see a church develop. Regardless of whether the groups remain as discovery groups or grow into churches, each should regularly reproduce itself consistent with the discipleship model you have been learning.
\p Starting a discovery group, which is the focus of this chapter, depends upon you developing a coaching relationship with the person of peace that the Holy Spirit has introduced you to.
\p One of the differences that a disciple maker has in building relationships with a person of peace compared to an evangelist working with a prospective convert, is the focus and scope of the relationship. For most westerners, relationships are with individuals. We ask questions and tell personal stories that focus around the activities of individuals we are reaching out to. “What do you do (work or school)? What sports, movies or television programs or music do you like?”
\p As a disciple maker, one of the first things you want to find out is about the person of peace’s social network and his or her relationship with the people in it. Is he a leader or a follower? If he is not a leader, can he influence the leader? All of this also means that you will become involved in the struggles and problems of your person of peace’s life.
\p Personally, I have found that as soon as I begin asking about a person’s family and friends the depth of our conversations increases. I find out about how he grew up, who he is living with, who his friends are. I learn about who cares for whom. I learn a lot more about the life of the person that I am reaching out to.
\p I find it helpful to write down the names of the friends and family members, what their needs are, and to begin praying for them. Each time we meet, I ask more questions and discover more about my person of peace. Many of my questions seek to find out how willing the person is to start a discovery group with his social network and how open they are to being part of it. As long as there is progress in our conversations, I continue with the relationship.
\p With one of my first people of peace, when I first mentioned starting a discovery group with his social network, it became apparent that his friends were not the best place for him to start a discovery group as they were trying to “evangelize” him back into selling drugs. I then began to focus on his family and to identify their needs and openness. When working with the person of peace it can be a process with “twists and turns.” As long as there is progress, even with occasional setbacks, proceed, but once it is evident that the person is not moving forward, then it is time to back off at least for a time.
\p A Muslim refugee family with whom we were beginning a discovery study seemed interested in the learning about God in the Bible. The wife had been a refugee in Jordan and had been helped by some Roman Catholic doctors. As we discussed their social network, we found that they had very few family ties in this country. She was Shia and he a Sunni. The other people they knew from their country were from different tribes and they didn’t trust or interact with them. Whatever their interest in studying the Bible, they were not good candidates at that time to be laborers, for they had no “field” to harvest.
\p Remember that the person of peace is the one whom God has sent you to in order that he or she can be equipped to bring in the harvest. You are working with the Holy Spirit and your job is to bring the person of peace to the Bible and hold him or her accountable to what he has heard God tell him he needs to change. His life may be really messed up, and probably is. Your job is \bd not\bd* to straighten out the mess. In time the Holy Spirit will address it. If your person of peace brings it up, then find a scripture passage or series of passages, that addresses it and let him discover what God has to say about the subject and take concrete steps as he is led by the Holy Spirit. Once it has been addressed return to your original study. Remember it is essential that there be a solid foundation developed.
\p I had an interesting experience as I was introducing my waiter friend to discovery studies and determining his interest in starting a study. He told me that had recently changed jobs. When I called him to confirm our meeting, he said that he had a real problem he needed help with. When we met he told me the following story. “I have always been an easy going guy. I never got mad at anyone, but in this new job I have yelled at a coworker once and my supervisor another time. It is like something has come over me and I am doing things that I don’t want to do. I don’t understand it?”
\p If you had been mentoring, what would you have done? Does any scripture passage come to mind? Well, it reminded me of the passage in Romans 7. So, we did a study on Romans 7:13-25. He was able to draw a direct connection between the Bible and his world. Once he had developed his awareness, he was able to address the situation with a couple of “I will” statements. Next week we returned to the discovering God Series and Genesis.
\p If someone in the discovery group is sick or a miraculous healing takes place, you may want to direct the facilitator to study one of Jesus’ many miraculous healings or the accounts of Peter healing the lame man (Acts 3:6), or raising Dorcas (Acts 9:40), or Paul with the young man killed from a fall (Acts 20:10).
\p There are two basic approaches to starting a discovery group with your person of peace. Which one you choose will depend on the relationship you develop and the confidence your person of peace has to start a study. In general the less direct involvement you have in the starting of the group, the better it will be in the long-term development of the group. Remember your goal in making disciples is to establish a supportive discovery group that will function on its own without your direct involvement and will continue replicating itself by starting other groups of disciples.
\p The least intrusive method is for you to train the person of peace to facilitate a study by doing several studies with him. In your study you facilitate the first few times then have him facilitate your one-on-one study while you coach.
\p After a few times of coaching, you can have him or her start his own discovery group with his family or social group. Before every meeting time you will complete a study with him and make sure that he understands the text and the key discoveries that the passage conveys as well as to debrief what happened during the preceding meeting.
\p If you have a group of facilitators, which can occur if there is rapid multiplication before the members of the initial group are ready to coach on their own, or the initial group is too large and has to be divided, you can have them take turns in their facilitator’s training group while you coach. (See figure 11.1)
\p In both of these cases you will never go to the discovery meeting unless you need to evaluate how things are going or the facilitator has questions that he needs to show you. If you go into a group, let the facilitator introduce you as someone interested in how the group operates. Do not let yourself be set up as an expert. Simply observe and if necessary ask a few questions, but never make corrections or offer opinions in the group.
\p The second approach is to go with the person of peace to his group and demonstrate the process the first time. After this first discovery group meeting you should meet with the person of peace apart from this meeting. Ask some general questions. What did he learn? What was happening with the other people in the group? How would he lead the group? In this same meeting explain that the next time he will lead the meeting, but you will be there to answer any questions as the meeting goes along. The third time you would just observe and make your coaching comments at the follow-up meeting. From that point on you will simply coach the facilitator. The goal is that the group will develop its identity and leadership apart from you.
\p In either of the two approaches, the follow-up meetings are critical both to review what happened and what will happen in the next meeting. It is important from the beginning to make sure that everyone in the discovery group is participating; that they are writing and completing their “I will” statements; and that they are telling the passage and what they have learned with someone outside the group.
\p Even if there are lapses in completing everything, it is important to keep this standard from the beginning: commit the passage to memory, “I and we will” statements, and tell someone else the passage from the Bible. It is very rare that a group that starts off doing only a part of the process will ever add the rest back in.
\p The facilitator should expect the participants to be uncertain the first few meetings. In general the format of the group is set in the first three or four meetings and is difficult or impossible to change afterwards. So, set and hold to expectations of memorization, application and telling in all of the meetings. Also, this is one reason that after the first couple of meetings the group should normally not add new members. If others want to join the group, they should be encouraged to start their own group. You can add this person to your facilitator training meeting with your current person of peace as we mentioned earlier. If your primary person of peace is capable and willing, he can start a separate mentoring meeting with this new person apart from your meetings with him. If this happens, your one-on-one meeting will need to include reporting and discussing how the second group is doing. (This will be explained more fully in Chapter 11.)
\p So what is an optimum size for a group? We have discussed this briefly before. In general 6 to 8 people provide the greatest amount of interaction. However, the key is the social group of the facilitator. If his social group is small, then that is the best size of the group. If it is an extended family or social group, then that is the best size of the group. If the group gets greater than a dozen, splitting it into separate groups for the actual study and then sharing together is best.
\p When City Team started their first discovery group in San Jose, California, Carmen, the woman who invited them to start a study group in her home had invited over sixty people. After the first meeting they split into three separate study groups of about 20 people, in part because of the limited space, but primarily because of group dynamics. So, the lesson here is to be flexible and adaptable.
\p The other area to concentrate on when starting a group is to train the facilitator in the mechanics of facilitating the meeting. Is he or she able to draw people out by asking questions? Does he make sure that everyone contributes regularly? Does he consistently assure that key discoveries from the passage are being made? Does he maintain the “no teaching or preaching” rule? Does he keep the group’s time on track and not allow the session to degenerate into counseling or gossip?
\p When coaching, it is important to keep in mind that the disciple making process is a “low control, but high accountability” process. That means that you should expect that the Holy Spirit and the scriptures will provide the direction to your person of peace/facilitator as they mature, but you are the one that must hold them accountable for fulfilling their commitments.
\b
\p David Watson’s approach for a “mature” facilitator is “if they fail to follow through once, I ask why. If the fail twice, I tell them they have to fulfill their commitments. If they fail three times, I put the relationship on hold, until they can demonstrate that they are willing and able to fulfill their commitments.” David was putting into practice Luke 10:10-11 “Whenever . . . they do not receive you . . . even the dust of our feet we shake off in protest.”
\b
\p \it Disciple making is a “low control, but high accountability” process.\it*

\p With a person of peace who has not yet come to a place of making a commitment to Jesus, you will have to be forbearing, but the same standard remains; obedience to God means accountability to you the disciple maker, and the group members to the facilitator, and one-another. If a person habitually fails to keep commitments to you, be assured that he will not keep his commitments to God either.
\p As much as you may like a person, remember as Jesus indicated when he told the 72 disciples not to stop and greet anyone along the way, you are on an assignment of Jesus. Your job is to find and prepare the person of peace to bring in the harvest in his family and social network and prepare them to do the same. (Luke 10:4)
\p You need to be constantly observing your facilitator and evaluating his abilities, personal discipline, dependability, commitment, and personal initiative, that is, what is the facilitator’s character and ability to make other disciples?
\p One of the questions you should be asking God is “how does God want to use this person? A quote of Shedanke Johnson, who is a church planting leader in Sierra Leone, that I particularly like is that, “It is not a person’s “background” that counts. It is his “in-ground” and his “end-ground.” In other words don’t let a person of peace’s history or background set your expectations for that person. Rather what is the character of the person of peace and what has God shown you that he himself can accomplish with this person in the future.
\p Shedanke tells stories of common house thieves and prostitutes who have become significant church planters after God got hold of them. However, it required a disciple maker who could discern the character of the person, his “in ground” and would seek and hear from God about what He wanted to do with the person, his “end ground.” And, of equal importance, will take the time to train and challenge the person of peace to fulfill that calling.
\p “\it It is not a person’s “background” that counts. It is his “in-ground” and his “end-ground.”\it* Shedanke Johnson
\p As the discovery group matures and the facilitator grows more capable. He or she should look for other people to train as facilitators within his group and equip to start other groups. For some people leading a single discovery group will be their limit, other people may have the ability and calling to mentor and train many others. Helping people reach their potential as disciples is one of the challenges that you as the disciple maker have.
\p As the relationship between you and the person of peace turned facilitator, matures, the relationship changes from one of trainer-instructor, to coach, to mentor, to colleague. I have gotten to be close friends with some of the men who I have been privileged to coach. We are co-laborers in this work.
\p As your network expands and deepens, one of the most important jobs you have is to assure that each group reproduces and remains faithful to the primary components of obedience-based discipleship. That is, each group is faithful to study, commit to memory, apply and share passages of the Bible. If any group fails in any of these areas it will fall short of fulfilling the commission that Jesus gave us.
\p We will talk more about this in the chapter eleven on replication. However, in terms of your ongoing relationship with the people you are mentoring, it means that your time with a mature disciple covers accountability for not only his group, but also the groups that the people he is coaching and mentoring are leading. You need to assure yourself that he is also holding everyone to the same standard. David Watson’s goal is that there be three levels of accountability up and three levels down. This has demonstrated to maintain fidelity to the standards of DMM.
\p The vision of reconciling the world to Jesus’ father in heaven can only be fulfilled by accepting the Great Commission as laid out in \bd Matthew 28:16-20\bd*. Having moved along in your own discipleship process, now is a good time to do your own discovery study on this passage. We started off this book with a series of questions and comments about it. Now, in your own notebook complete a three or four column written study and then with your own group discuss and write your own “discoveries” and “I will” statements and “we will” statements.
\p Read from the beginning of the chapter (28:1) to understand the context and the method that Jesus used to direct the eleven disciples to go to Galilee. What does that tell you about the roles that different people play in accomplishing the purposes of God? In your and your group’s study of the passage consider what supporting structures you will need to be fully successful in your mission. The eleven disciples would not have gotten to the point of receiving Jesus’ last commandment had it not been for the network of support that they had around them.
\p As key as it is to fully understand and embrace the command of Jesus to make disciples, it is important to realize what Jesus purpose is in filling the world with disciples. We will learn in your next study of Matthew 16:13-21 that Jesus’ mission includes doing something through these men. Creating a foundation of disciples is Jesus’ prerequisite for his next work, building his church. We don’t learn until the epistles that Jesus’ final plan for the church is that, in the fullness of time, the church will be transformed into something very special for him, a bride who in the final hour, will be reconciled to him as a woman is to her husband through marriage. For this to happen all of the members of the church will need to arrive at a place similar to that of Peter in this passage; by being disciples who are able to hear directly from God.
\p Jesus spent the greatest part of his years of public ministry training and forming his disciples. One of the difficult things about reading and studying the gospels is that Jesus doesn’t provide the clear answers to our questions that the epistles do. For years this frustrated me. It was not until I began to dig into the passage you will study next that I realized that everything that Jesus did was to bring his disciples to the point that Simon Peter reached in Matthew 16:16. A very important question to ask as you study this passage is this: what was so critical to Jesus’ mission with Simon Peter’s profession of faith, that once it took place, Jesus would make a complete shift in the direction of his ministry?
\p As you study this passage there are a few things about Jesus remarks in verse 18 that give it a lot of color and deep meaning. First, the name Simon, in Hebrew means “one who hears.” Second, Peter’s father’s name according to John 1:42 is “John;” Jonah is the name of the prophet. Third, the Hebrew word “Bar” means “son of.” Fourth, the Greek word for Peter, means “little rock” and the Greek word for “rock” the Bible uses in the phrase “upon this rock” means “bed-rock.”
\p In addition to the standard questions, “What do you learn about God?” and “What do you learn about man?” dig into what is Jesus saying about planting churches? What was the background, the process, and the final result in the life of Simon-Peter? How does that apply to us and our mission of becoming and making disciples? Is it the individual Peter, who is the key to Jesus building his church, or something broader?
\p As you and your group meet, there are some important “we will” statements that should be developed. Spend enough time probing this passage so that it sets the direction that you move in in the future, both as individuals and as a group. Address it in both general terms which may lead to a “mission statement” and specific terms that may lead to a “strategy” for your discovery group.

\p “Instructions for planting churches”
\p Watch video 13, “Preparing a Person of Peace for leadership,” by Jim Yost 2.
\p After your discovery group has completed this study, take some time to synthesize what you have learned about your role in the discipleship process in Matthew 23:8-11 and John 14:24-27 and your role in planting churches. Who “makes” disciples? Who “builds” the church? What is your role in “making disciples?” What is your role in “building the church?” What resources does God give you to complete your part of “making disciples?” What resources does God give you for your role in “planting churches?”
\p It is important to understand that our partnership with Jesus and the Holy Spirit does not change as we move from making disciples to planting churches. The resources and our role remain the same and are adequate for both tasks.
\li Develop a “mission statement” for your discovery group and develop a short strategy plan for achieving your mission.
\b
\li Continue to pray for more workers and the specific needs of the people of peace you are working with as well as the needs of their own discovery group.

\periph Chapter 11. The Disciple Maker in New Cultures
\ms1 Chapter 11
\ms2 The Disciple Maker in New Cultures
\p Among the responsibilities of the disciple maker is to “de-culture” the gospel. Part of the task of the new believers is to “contextualize” the gospel into their own culture. The “discovery process” enables both of these things happening by its design.
\p Every person who grows up in a culture assumes a basic understanding of the world and relational practices that conform to that society. We do this without thinking about there being a choice in most of these things. It is just the “way it is.”
\p Nothing comes as a greater shock to people, as they start reaching out to others outside their normal social circles, than the different world-views that people have. My wife Cindy and I joke about her perceptions that “she” did not have an accent, which she maintained until we were in a restaurant in Johannesburg, South Africa and she tried to order a pitcher of water. After the third try the head-waiter came over and said that none of the three waiters could understand what she had ordered. When she spelled out “w-a-t-e-r,” he said “oh, you have such a heavy accent no one could understand you.”
\p Our lack of our cultural awareness is usually deeper than merely our failure to realize that every region of the English speaking world has its own accent and that it is us not “them” who have an accent.
\p We assume that people want the same things that we do and have the same freedom to make decisions that we do.
\p One of the best books on understanding other cultures is the short book, \it Foreign to Familiar, A Guide to Understanding Hot and Cold Climate Cultures,\it* by Sarah A. Lanier, McDougal Publishing\it .\it*
\p I was doing “door-to-door” evangelism around our church a few years ago. I struck up a conversation with a Hmong man who had a young family. As we discussed scriptures, he was obvious very interested in becoming a Christian. He said, “I want very much to become a Christian, but my father who is the head of our clan will not permit it. I cannot dishonor my father. He is very old and when he dies, I will become the leader and our family and our entire clan will accept Jesus.”
\p The religious underpinning of societies controls much of the social interactions of those societies. Christians who live in Muslim societies have social interactions that more closely resemble their Muslim neighbors than they do those of Christians in western nations. An atheist in America will have a world-view deeply shaped by the Christian society he grew up in. An atheist in a Muslim country will have his world-view shaped by Islam. The two people will hold intrinsically different views of life even though they profess to be atheists.
\p The traditional European and American cultures are “individualistic.” In Africa, the Middle-East, Asia, and Latin America the cultures are “family” based. In family structured communities there is clear hierarchical leadership. If you ask thirty people in a family structured society, who their leader is, most or all of them will give the same answers.
\p In 2013 we were in Makeni, Sierra Leone, a city of a few hundred thousand people located in a very heavily Muslim area. We were visiting some friends who were translating the Old Testament into the Themne language. We asked several people on the street of their neighborhood, who their leader was. We received the names of the same “chief” and the name of the same “imam.” Even though it was a city, its social structure was that of a village.
\p These family based societies embrace obedience based discipleship readily and multiply along the lines of family authority and relationships. It is an interesting note that homeless people and college students, who are without any family at all, often embrace the discovery group process and multiply rapidly, not through hierarchical leadership, but because the look for anyone who offers any leadership. Their hunger for family and identity are strong attractors and their transient status means that they frequently form new relationships.
\p Our Western individualistic societies are characterized by fragmented families and a lack of leadership. Social groups are often of more importance than the families that people grow up in. These social groups can be their work teams, bridge clubs, bowling leagues, skate-board groups; athletic groups, any group that gives its members an identity. Multiplying discovery groups is often more effective within these groups than families of the people of peace with whom we are working. One of the important priorities of working with a person of peace in this type of fractured society is to train them as leaders.
\p Regardless of the country, large rapidly growing mega-cities have similar demographic structures. They are largely made up of individuals whose current social groupings probably revolve more around their work and social activities than family. With immigrant communities their religious institutions often provide an identity for them; especially when they are minority cultures such as the many immigrant communities in our country today.
\p When there are only a few individuals of a particular cultural group in a city, they can be easily reached as individuals. This is a great opportunity to invite them to know Jesus. But when there is a large enough number and they feel that they are in a hostile culture, they can “close ranks” and form protective societies. This was the case for the Irish in the 19th century, the Italians in the early 20th century, and now the Somalis, Hmong, Vietnamese and other recent immigrant groups. Where a particular religion defines their identity, an ethnic group can become very resistant to the gospel and entrance by an outsider can take strategy, time, and effort. Even an inside-believer can face great hostility.
\p What we do and how we approach a culture requires both prayer and research. As you learned in the chapter on prayer, we need to be deeply knowledgeable about the people that Jesus has sent us to reach and we need to be diligent and disciplined in prayer.
\p Let us look at four key questions that address some of the important aspects of cultural sensitivity. These are good questions to repeat to yourselves as you move to engage a group of people:
\li \bd How do I engage my target community without creating unnecessary barriers to the gospel?\bd* Even within our extended natural family there may be barriers. Aunts and uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, children and parents, each may have different value systems. People in the same church can approach God and relationships in vastly different ways. What are some of the barriers that you have already experienced? What can you do to bridge the gaps?
\p As soon as you know individuals in the people group you want to reach, you can begin asking questions that will help you come to a deeper understanding of their lives. If done correctly, this will increase your understanding of, and relationship with, both the individual and their culture. Questions about how they see and relate to their parents and other family members are always good ways to grow in understanding both the culture and the individuals’ positions in it. What are their desires and goals for their lives, if they have any? What is their idea of fun and entertainment? How does their family relate to the same things your person of peace likes or dislikes? What do they do for holidays?
\p Compare these things with your own values. What do you like to do that might enhance your engagement with the people you want to reach? What things should you be careful not to do or say? How will make sure that you don’t offend? Is there something that you can do to build rather than offend?
\li \bd How do I ensure I am in sync with what God is doing?\bd* Do you have any idea of what God is already doing with a people that you are trying to reach? Has anyone shared any experiences that they have had with God? This is another good avenue of inquiry and can deepen your relationship.
\p I recall in one job I had, two coworkers confided in me some very deep spiritual experiences they had had. Learning how to be open and to ask the right questions is important. For instance, did you have any spiritual experiences prior to your committing yourself to following Jesus? Sharing stories about the things that began to open your life to the work of the Holy Spirit can be good bridge builders. Being open with people and sharing openly about some of your struggles you have had prior to making a serious commitment to Jesus can be very helpful in building bridges. However, “glory stories” can turn people off. The stories you tell must be ones that the person you are talking to can relate to in their current relationship with God.
\p Most Christians are taught to “share their testimony,” and these story are excellent to glorify God and encourage believers, but may set a wall between ourselves and the person in whom the Holy Spirit is just beginning his work. Even though I personally, had a very dramatic and miraculous encounter with God, as I look back upon my life up to that point, there were a series of events that prepared me for that encounter. It is these “pre-conversion” stories that can often connect to people who are being drawn to God. Share one of these stories and then ask if your prospective person of peace has any similar or different experiences. The point is to help the other person begin to recognize what God is already doing in his or her life.
\p The goal is to encourage the person you are talking to, to share about his own current journey of faith. Is he an atheist, New Age, a Muslim, Jew, Hindu, or something else? Can he tell you about “how” they made that decision? What was the series of events that led up to this point in his life? All the while you are listening, ask God to show you what he is doing in this person’s life.
\li \bd What commands of Jesus am I not consistently obeying?\bd* It is easy, once we start reaching people, to become caught up in the relational and logistical activities and forget our own discipling process. Committing to memory all of the commands of Jesus and obeying them are two of the internal disciplines of a disciple that produces these miraculous movements around the world. Our ability to mentor and coach others can only increase if we continue growing as disciples ourselves. So, along with deepening prayer, being diligent in our own discipleship process is essential.
\p We work in a partnership with Jesus. He and the Holy Spirit have no less interest in deepening our own relationship with him, than he does in leading the person of peace into a deep relationship. If as disciple makers, we are to hold the people we are mentoring accountable to fulfilling their commitments to Jesus, are we to be less accountable ourselves?
\p On the positive side of the equation is the deepening love relationship that develops between us and God as we continue faithfully in the walk of discipleship. Paul’s phrases often reflect this relationship, “to die is gain, to live is Christ” is one of them. (Philippians 1:21) Our ultimate goal is to be fully united with Christ to God the Father.
\li \bd How do I encourage multiplication?\bd* As your person of peace is learning to facilitate a group, it is important to set and hold the standard of not only the application, “I will” and “we will” statements, but also that people plan and share the passage that they have learned with someone else. Teach the facilitator about recognizing other people of peace and having them pass that on to their discovery group.
\li There are two options on training the facilitator of the new group. (See figure 11.1) If the primary relationship is with one of the discovery group members, and the person you are mentoring is capable and willing, then encourage replication of the same mentoring relationship that you and he have. Then comes the question, “what do I do once someone in my group has found an interested person?” In general you want to communicate from the beginning that the facilitator should expect to see other groups start from the sharing and discussion of the passages with people outside the discovery group.
\b
\tr \tc1 Option 1: \tc2 DM → Fo \tc3 Fn → Gn
\b
\tr \tc1 \tc2 \tc3 Fo → Go
\tr \tc1 Option 2: \tc2 DM →
\tr \tc1 \tc2 \tc3 \p Fn → Gn

\tr \tc1 \tc2 \tc3 Go - Original Group
\tr \tc1 \tc2 \tc3 Gn - New Group
\b
\p Figure 11.1 – \it Second Generation mentoring options\it*
\p The second, if this inquiry happens early in the discovery group’s development and the facilitator is unable or unwilling (usually if they are willing, God will make them able), is to invite the new facilitator to join your mentoring group, at least for a time. To assure ongoing multiplication the core elements, which is the DNA of the discovery process, must be replicated in the new group and all the facilitators must maintain the same standards.
\li \bd What is your own cultural orientation?\bd* We talked earlier about the fact that all – ALL – of us have inherited and been integrated into a specific culture that is different than other cultures. There are foods that we considered good and others that we don’t. There are greetings that we expect, the way we relate to people of the opposite gender, the way we show respect. It is good to start by telling ourselves, that there is no ONE right way to do things. This can be difficult.
\p Crossing your legs in some cultures is very offensive, especially if the bottom of the shoe points to someone. In Mexico, you shouldn’t look at a baby unless you also touch it. In most Muslim cultures a man should never touch a woman and vice versa and that includes shaking hands. Refusing to eat food set before you is almost always seen as a rejection of hospitality – take at least one bite. What is the proper role of men and women? What is appropriate dress? The list is nearly endless. So, what are some of your own cultural “norms?” Remember our goal is to bring the gospel to people. If the culture needs to change, then let the Holy Spirit and the Bible drive the change, but accept that it likely will not look like yours.
\li \bd How can you prepare yourself to adapt to other cultures?\bd* Are going to reach the homeless; Hindus, college students, others? Take some time to investigate what the cultural practices are. In most cases you will never entirely “fit in” a different culture, but you can anticipate and adapt so that you are not offensive.
\li \bd Separate religious culture from the presentation of the gospel.\bd* This means to separate \bd our\bd* religious culture from the gospel. The gospel, however, must be contextualized into the receiving culture. This is one of the roles that the discovery groups naturally play. Likewise they will modify practices in their culture that are not compatible with the words of the Bible. All of this happens by means of their “we will” statements.
\p It does not, however, mean modifying their practices to match ours. (See figure 1.1) Rather, as the new believers discover and obey what they learn in the Bible, they are the ones to identify what and how their culture needs to be modified to conform to the words they have read.
\p The simplest way of doing our part of de-culturing the gospel is to stick to reading and discovery from the Bible itself. Make sure that the facilitator can give you the Biblical basis for all of the practical applications of their discovery group. Be curious and take good notes. It there is need for a broader understanding by the group, then direct them to additional passages, but leave the discovery and modifications to them. The only standard you should hold them to, is that they can point to a solid Biblical explanation to their practices, even if you disagree with their interpretation.
\p Here is an example from Afghanistan where a group of men who were new believers were discussing how they should treat their wives and children. The asked their mentor to explain the way that believers should treat their wives, for their new faith in Christ had not changed any of their family behavior, but they sensed that it should. Rather than teach them, their mentor led them to Genesis 2 and several passages in the Epistles. The result was that after much discussion and discovery, the group of men decided that since God created woman to be their help-mate, that they needed to involve their wives in their lives and ministries in a more respectful way.
\p Over several weeks they came up with several “we will” and “I will” statements and they reported on the impact it was having with their families. Their conformance was based on the standards of the Bible, not on our standards. A second benefit was that they learned how to seek out things in the Bible to apply to their lives.
\p One of my favorite expressions which I have mentioned, “before you go, be prepared and when you are there be aware” applies here. When you begin working with a person of peace, as a minimum be prepared to be surprised and hold your words of correction before they come out of your mouth. Then seek for scripture passages to have them study. As they are discovering God in the Bible, you are discovering more about their culture.
\p In India as in many cultures, people are segregated by age, gender, and class. If you have a mixed group of youth, men, women, and old, only the men will speak and the older men will have priority. It is possible that over time, the culture of these disciples will become more inclusive, but there is no guarantee, and as we remain outsiders, our job is to work with the culture not to change it, so in this case perhaps it will be better to separate the men from the women and even older from younger, so that everyone can share. Training your person of peace who is facilitating to make sure that everyone in his study is sharing is important. Ask him about how that going. If there are deficiencies in this area explore ways to resolve it.
\p One of the things that I have done when training in India is to watch the way people sit in the group and interact. People who are not fully involved tend to sit just outside the circle. The next thing is to watch who is talking and their gender and age. If there is a pattern of gender or age segregation, then I have the facilitator explore ways to reorganize the discovery group.
\p As much as Americans are committed to “integrating” the church at least in our words, we are working against cultural barriers that may be God ordained or at least blessed.
\iq1 \bd Revelations 7:9\bd* After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb,
\p One Latino pastor was explaining to me the challenge of pastoring a “multi-national” Hispanic church. He said the church splits along three lines, those who do not eat tamales and those that do and then again between those who wrap tamales in corn husks and those who wrap them in banana leaves. The point he was making is that culture is not just a language or racial matter and that there is no one “right” culture.
\p As a group, discuss:
\li What are your experiences with different cultures? Are there any ideas or general principles that you can draw from them and how could you apply them in the future?
\li How can you separate the gospel from your culture (eating, clothing, family, individual identity?
\li Who can coach you in reaching into a different culture? Often the person of peace can fulfill this role. Even with people in your own neighborhood or extended family, social practices differ. Asking about how people celebrate birthdays and holidays, the family order, and work ethics can both help you understand the people you are trying to reach and build your relationship with the person of peace you are mentoring.
\li What are some of your cultural additions (music, order of service, etc.) to the Bible’s model of the church? Are any of these are essential? As a group make a list of the absolute essentials for a church to function.
\li What are the minimum requirements for a church? Think through what you can recall from the Bible.
\p In the next chapter we will look at what skills a disciple maker needs in a new culture and the model that Paul of Tarsus used. Do written discovery studies on the following short three passages.
\p \bd I Corinthians 9:19-23\bd*. – Paul’s orientation to different cultures
\p \bd Philippians 2:1-5\bd* – Paul’s model for cultural flexibility – how did this influence Paul’s approach to cultures? How does this demonstrate Paul as a disciple of Jesus,’ application of what he learned from Jesus?
\p \bd Acts 17:22-27\bd* – Example of Paul’s transcultural practice. What do you learn about Paul’s contextualization and the proclamation of the truth?

\periph Chapter 12. What is A Disciple Maker?
\ms1 Chapter 12
\ms2 What is A Disciple Maker?
\p As much as we are focusing on finding people of peace, developing relationships, and encouraging them in starting and facilitating their discovery group, we also need to focus on our role as a disciple maker.
\p One of the key components of engaging people is compatibility with the person that you are trying to reach. This includes age, education, interests, and marriage status. In general being a few years older is helpful. Having the same level of education helps communication. Sharing general interests and marriage status allows deep discussions and empathetic understanding. Even through there are cultural differences, these common experiences greatly facilitate developing a long-lasting relationship with the person of peace.
\p These natural bridges are not absolute requirements, but in general give some guidance to looking for and training disciple makers. If the population that you desire to reach is young, then young men and women make the best people to send. If the population is highly educated, then sending people who are educated is preferable. Since the contrary is usually the case, training people who have little education to reach them should be something you consider. God is in control and can establish whatever relationships he wants, but since he created us with certain characteristics, he usually will work along those lines.
\p \bd A Disciple Maker Is Not\bd*:
\p Depending on our personal sense of worth, ability, or understanding we may take on more or less responsibility for the work than God expects from us. Following is a list of things that a disciple maker is not:
\p He or she is \bd not Superman or Superwoman\bd*. It is likely and almost certain, that the disciple maker will see or participate in many miraculous things. But it is not the work of the disciple maker, rather it is the Holy Spirit who is working unseen along side of him. There are two dangers in seeing ourselves in the role of an “anointed” minister of God or superman, the first is that our ego will swell and we can become susceptible to seeking the praises of men.
\p The other side of the coin, is that we can begin to believe that the outcome of the discipling work depends on us. If our person of peace fails to respond, we try to work harder or apply pressure. Remember that we are in a partnership with Jesus and the Holy Spirit. We are junior partners; nothing happens apart from what God is doing in the hearts of people we are working with. Discipleship is Jesus’ project in which we are privileged to participate.
\p A disciple maker is \bd not a paid professional\bd*. Disciple-making needs to be a passion that you do whenever and wherever you are. It is not a career path. Paul, took some pride in supporting himself in his work of establishing churches. So, plan on some way to support yourself in this work and learn to rely on Jesus to provide what is needed, even as Paul did.
\p A disciple maker is usually \bd not highly educated\bd*. Since most people are not highly educated and communications is a key to building relationships, being able to talk at the same level as the people you want to reach is very important. I recall talking at a bridge inspector conference some years ago, when I was working as a structural engineer. One of the burly inspectors was talking to me afterwards. He said, “I really like what you were trying to tell us, but I didn’t know half the words you were using.”
\p On the opposite side of this is a recent training that I did in Mexico. My American colleague Kevin, is a very simple Minnesota farmer who could not conjugate a verb in Spanish, but the Mexican’s loved him, because he used very simple language to communicate. Even children could understand him.
\p It is not just that an educated person’s vocabulary differs from an uneducated person, but even his mental process changes. This means that people with similar educational backgrounds and experiences will be best able to relate and identify with one another.
\p A disciple maker is \bd not credentialed\bd* by a certifying body. A degree in discipleship does not make you a disciple maker. Jesus is looking for people he can work with. The most important thing you can do to become a disciple maker, is to become a disciple of Jesus yourself. Jesus will bring people to you. As we have learned before, we accompany people to Jesus in the scriptures, in groups, where Jesus and the Holy Spirit can do the teaching.
\p A disciple maker is \bd not a CEO.\bd* Even the executives of mission organizations are not necessarily good disciple makers. Seek to find your identity in being a disciple of Jesus. Beware of people exalting your success. Being a CEO of an organization does not mean you cannot be a disciple maker, but your position in society, ministry, or business is not what qualifies you.
\p A disciple maker is not \bd powerful or influential\bd* in the organizational or popularity sense. Whatever power or influence that a disciple maker has, flows from his relationship with Jesus. There are callings and giftings that we receive from God that the Holy Spirit will use. (Romans 11:29) Growing and maturing in these callings and giftings is part of what becoming a disciple is about. Obviously Peter had certain leadership gifts from the beginning, but it took intensive training by Jesus to render him fully effective. There are people with strong charismatic gifts, whom people tend to follow, but that in itself does not make them effective disciple makers.
\p A disciple maker is \bd not a pastor,\bd* in the sense of the institutional church. In our western church model, a pastor is the head of the church organization or a sub-organization within the church, such as Senor Pastor, Youth Pastor. The role of a pastor as we have defined it within Christian circles, is to care for people, to teach, to preach, to administer, among many other things. There is another way to think about what a pastor is.
\p I had an interesting encounter with God one morning a few years ago. A small voice inside my head asked me “what is a pastor?” I answered, “a pastor is a man to cares for the people in his church and feeds them the Word of God.” The same small voice said, “I don’t mean in the church, I mean among sheep in the pasture.”
\p When I was a young man I spend a summer working surveying roads on a ranch in Wyoming. During this time I had the opportunity to talk to one rancher who ran a mix of cattle and sheep. Now this was one of the largest ranches in the state and they had several flocks of 1000 sheep. Each flock had a Basque shepherd that was brought over from northern Spain. Each shepherd lived in a little domed trailer which was moved with the flocks to the different pastures. It seemed to me to be the most boring job in the world, to sit out on the prairies of Wyoming every day and watch sheep eat grass.
\p I had a couple conversations with the rancher about shepherding.
\p Me: “Why do you hire Basque to be shepherds?”
\p “Because they are use to living in solitude and have experience working with dogs. This is a very lonely job. They come over on a two year contract and save up enough money to start a life in their country.”
\p Me: “What are the most difficult duties of a shepherd?”
\p “Lambing season. With 1000 ewes, lambing is a 24 hour a day job for more than two weeks. The shepherd sleeps and eats with the sheep during this time.”
\p Me: “What are the main duties of the shepherd?”
\p The shepherd needs to keep an eye on the pasture, once it is nearing depletion, he must identify the next pasture and make plans to move them there. This can mean arranging trucks and extra help. I check on the shepherds from time to time to see what they need. We move the flocks from the prairies in the middle of the summer when the grass dries up here and truck them to the mountains until the winter starts. Then we bring them back here for the winter”
\p On a daily basis, every morning the shepherd needs to watch when the sheep rise up.”
\p Me: “Why?”
\p “Old ewes often will not get up with the flock.”
\p Me: “So, what difference does that make? Won’t they eventually get up when they are hungry?”
\p “No, they will stay down and die in a few days.”
\p Me: “What do you do?”
\p “See these pointy-toe boots (lifting one of his cowboy boots), you walk over and kick the ewe as hard and long as necessary until she gets up. Every morning you watch and repeat the process. After the third time, when she sees you coming, she will get up on her own. A ewe will live two or three more years with ‘proper attention.’”
\p So, that morning when the voice said “among the sheep in the pasture” I knew first off that a true shepherd, a pastor, never feeds the sheep. His job is to get the sheep to the pasture and make sure they feed themselves. When Jesus told Peter to “feed my sheep” he would have known that that meant to make sure that they were in a place where they could feed themselves. I think we in the church have spiritualized things to the point that we don’t have the context of reality and therefore have developed a culture in which the “sheep” cannot feed themselves.
\p In context of disciple making movements there is a need for a “shepherd, a pastor” to make sure that the members of a discovery group are studying the right passages in the Bible that both address their needs and move them along into a deeper relationship with Jesus. As I have mentioned earlier, when things occur among the members of a discovery group, it may be necessary to modify what the group studies until the need is met and everyone discovers and applies the truths in the Bible that apply to their situation. In this sense, a disciple maker needs to train the facilitator to “pastor” the people in his discovery group.
\b
\p \it Good questions come along every so often in people’s lives. If they receive the answer to these questions directly from God it will not only change the person’s life, but also the world around them.\it*
\b
\p A disciple maker is not \bd “The Answer Person.”\bd* If you, like myself, have grown up in a “teaching” oriented culture, there is trained disposition in us to provide the answers to a person’s questions, sometimes, even when we don’t really know the answer. There is a sense of superiority or at least satisfaction in being able to answer a person’s question.
\p I have been in some countries where it is considered impolite or the person would lose face, if they did not answer a stranger’s question even if the answer given is wrong. In chapter two we talked briefly about “good questions.” Good questions come along every so often in people’s lives. If they receive the answer to these questions directly from God it will not only change the person’s life, but also the world around them. We can steer them to the scriptures and to God in prayer.
\p The roll of the disciple maker is to train people to look to God for his directions and answers directly in prayer and in the Bible. A disciple maker needs to learn how to answer a question by asking another question or to lead the person to passage in the Bible that pertains to their question. Though I am getting better at it, it is still a skill that I am trying to master.
\p A disciple maker is not the \bd “Controller”\bd* of what happens in people’s lives. We talked briefly in chapter 10 that disciple making movements are “high accountability” but “low control.” As organizations grow larger there is increasing tendencies to set up “government” and for the governing authorities to begin to exert more and more control. Government like this does provide more stability and dependability for a group of people. In general, the larger the group, the more government is needed. The cost is that people shift their allegiance to them, the government or organization, and away from God.
\p The goal of DMM is that Jesus and the Holy Spirit will be the controlling and directing authority of every disciple. We see the same tension in Israel in the books of Samuel, when the people asked Samuel to choose a king for them. Whatever the merits or problems with having some sort of “control” over a society or group of people, as disciple makers our role and mandate is to assure that it is Jesus and the Holy Spirit, through discovery in the Bible, that are the ones in control. Our role of holding people accountable to what God is calling them to do is critical in the process.
\p My personal observations are that people who are “internally governed” by God according to the Bible, need much less external government than those who are not. This is one reason why it is valuable and important for parents to raise children who are disciples of Jesus rather than merely believers.
\p Finally, a disciple maker is \bd not focused on position.\bd* This is somewhat related to not being a salaried position. I have friends who are missionaries in other countries. They have established or are part of ministries or mission bases that are intended to be permanent stations in the country. These ministries serve many needed functions, but in themselves, are not adequate for the task of disciple making. They may train and send out disciple makers, but need to keep a “hands-off” policy as to what happens with the discipleship discovery groups. The Holy Spirit can best work, when people know that it is he, not a human being who is in control.
\p In order for an indigenous movement to start and grow, it is important that the disciple maker have as little direct visible connection with what is happening as possible. “Leaving early” needs to be one of the goals of the disciple maker.
\p I use to think about how much better things would have been if Jesus could have taught and led for more than three and one-half years. How wonderful it would have been if Jesus had been physically involved in planting and forming the first churches, clarifying things like baptism, communion, salvation by grace.
\p Involvement in DMM for these few years has shown me that like everything else he calls us to do, Jesus modeled raising up disciples who were able to facilitate his building churches and then he modeled leaving early. As soon as he had disciples in the places of hearing from his father in heaven he began planning and executing his exit. (Matthew 16:13-21)
\p Discipleship is a relational process, not an organizational or hierarchical one. Our role is to equip the person of peace, who has the relationships in his or her community to function as the worker in the field to reap the harvest that the Lord is looking for. If a church emerges, then it should be one that is faithful to the Bible, but is contextualized in every way possible to the surrounding culture.
\p Having looked at what a disciple maker is \bd not\bd*, let us turn the tables and look at the essential characteristics of a disciple maker.
\p A disciple maker is first \bd a disciple of Jesus.\bd* On a daily basis he or she personally spends time doing a written discovery study, memorizing, discovering, applying in to his own life in obedience and telling it to other people. His readings include both Old and New Testament, with thought given to understanding and applying Jesus’ interpretation. He has at least one other person with whom he can discover more about God weekly and will hold him accountable to complete his promises to God.
\p One of the wonderful things about introducing people to the disciple making process is that each new disciple has the potential to change the world around him or her. Each new disciple of Jesus that you make is the product of your own relationship with Jesus. Because of your disciple relationship, Jesus can use you. The more your relationship with Jesus as a disciple deepens, the more he can and will use you.
\p \bd A Big Caution:\bd* It is easy to become too busy doing things for God and fail to do the work of building and maintaining your own relationship with Jesus.
\p A disciple maker is \bd passionately in love with Jesus\bd*. One of the most satisfying results of being a disciple of Jesus is that your love for him grows continually. There is direct connection between love and obedience and obedience and love. As Jesus said, “if you love me you will obey my commandments,” and “he who obeys my commandments abides in my love, even as I obey the commandments of my father and abide in his love.” (John 14:15 and John15:10).
\p A disciple maker is a\bd servant for Jesus\bd* of everyone that Jesus is reaching out to. (Matthew 23:11). The heart of a servant rejoices in meeting the needs of others because that is the heart of Jesus. Jesus lives to make intercession for us (Isaiah 53:12). If you enjoy helping others, then you indeed have the heart to be a servant of Jesus.
\p A disciple maker is \bd obedient to the Word of God and listens to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\bd* Everything we are doing is centered upon the words in the Bible. However, it is also important that a disciple maker learn to hear from God directly, even as Peter did in his professing that Jesus was the messiah, the Son of the living God. (Matthew 16:16). Cultivating an ear to hear God takes time, but is possible for any believer to do. Being humble enough to receive God’s word from unlikely sources, even at the eleven did in obeying Mary Magdalen and the other Mary (Matthew 28:10)
\p A disciple maker is a \bd life-long learner.\bd* As long as we live, Jesus and his Holy Spirit will teach us though the words of the Bible, through our experiences, the words and experiences of others, and from direct revelation. There are many things that give value in our lives by being disciples of Jesus. The continual learning about God and his purposes for our lives is one of them.
\p A disciple maker is \bd “an insider.”\bd* So how does that work when we are “outsiders” to most of the groups that we want to reach?
\p First, it means that we need to recognize that once we try to reach outside of our own cultural group, we will be the outsider. Our access is through the insider, the person of peace. If we want to practice facilitating, it will be with other believers in our social network.
\p Second, it means that as we develop the person of peace so that he or she becomes a skilled facilitator and then disciple of Jesus, he will be the one who will be able to make disciples within their own social group. He will become a disciple maker as well. The most productive time of a person of peace in reaching their own community will be in the first few months of into entering the discipleship process.
\p A disciple maker’s time with a community is \bd short term.\bd* We have talked about this at some length. Our goal is to see self-replicating indigenous groups that can become actual churches as God directs.
\p A disciple maker is \bd one who leads through influence rather than position.\bd* Somewhere in my past someone made the statement, that anyone who has a clear vision and a way of accomplishing it, has influence in the lives of those who have similar interest, but lack either or both vision and a way of accomplishing it.
\p In a church where people believe that discipleship is of value, but don’t know what a disciple is, why it is important, and how to make them, you as an active disciple of Jesus will carry influence.
\p You will have a lot of influence in life of the person of peace, since you have a vision for his life and a way for him to draw closer to God who is actively calling him.
\p A disciple maker is a \bd lover of people.\bd* The connection that Jesus makes about loving God with all our hearts, souls, minds, and strength and loving our neighbor as ourselves is tied to Jesus’ mission and his reason to coming to earth, as we will see in Philippians 2:1-8. As we have seen in Chapter 2, one of the five disciplines of a first century disciple that Ed Gross describes is imitating the rabbi. That is especially true in making Jesus’ mission, his love, and his passion our own. \it No greater love has any man than he lay down his life for his friends.\it* (John 15:13)
\p A disciple maker is a \bd catalyst to church planting.\bd* As we saw in the discovery study on Matthew 16:13-21, the formation of a bedrock of disciples and the discipleship process is the foundation that Jesus will use to build his church. Just as we are called as disciple makers to train those who facilitate the discovery process, it is by this same process that we catalyze the planting of churches.
\p \it An “Influencer” is a person with vision and knowledge of how to accomplish it.\it*
\b
\p In other words, just as we direct a study of the Bible to discover God and Jesus, so we continue to direct other studies of the Bible, so that the group can discover what it means to become a church. (see Appendix 2) In both the discovering of God process and the discovering of church, we rely on the Holy Spirit to do the teaching.
\p Watch video 11, “Disciple Maker,” by Richard Williams and the Conclusion of Ed Gross’ series on First Century Discipleship, video 2.
\p With your discovery group, complete the entire group process using the following three passages for your discovery study. The Philippians passage not only lays out the mission and sacrifice of Jesus, but it also gives a clear picture of what Paul was using as his model for his own interactions with different cultures. In the 1Corinthians passage Paul explains his general philosophy which you can see reflects his understanding of what Jesus modeled. The Acts passage gives a graphic example of how Paul implemented his vision for reaching the lost.
\p In addition to the standard three discovery questions: “what is this passage about?,” “what do you discover about God?,” and “what do you discover about man?,” discuss Paul’s focus on Jesus as a model, what was Paul’s philosophy, and how do you see it at work in his address in the Areopagus. As you wrap up the study discuss how you can apply this to your work with the people that you are trying to reach.
\iq1 \bd Philippians 2:5-8\bd* Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, \v 6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, \v 7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. \v 8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.

To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law. \v 21 To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law. \v 22 To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some. \v 23 I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.

\ms1 Chapter 13
\ms2 Replication and Getting Started
\p We are at the end of the beginning. The question is what do you do now? What should be your next steps?
\p We have talked about developing action plans of various types during this study. It is not so much the written plan that matters, as it is the mental process that you go through to develop it. In one essay about military strategy and planning that I read years ago, it was said that no battle has ever been won without a plan, but once the battle starts the plan goes out the window and the successful general must adapt quickly. Under stress, any logical plan is better than no plan.
\p So it is with these plans of yours. Without plans of: with whom, when, and how you will share a passage; without a plan for prayer; without a plan for implementing what you have learned, the chances of success are small. Once implemented, plans give you a basis to start, but will need to be updated regularly as the unexpected happens.
\p Before we address the questions about next steps, we are going to discuss replication. A good bit of information about replication has already been covered in Chapter 10, which discussed starting a discovery group with the person of peace. We also mentioned earlier that there are different studies to use in developing disciples. We have been looking at the Discovering Disciple Making series to develop you as disciple makers (See appendix 2). The passages you have been studying would not mean much to anyone who was not already a believer and follower of Jesus Christ, so as look at moving forward, we will take a look at the first discovery series, “Discovering God”. Finally, we will start looking at applying what you have already learned with people who are not yet believers. For this section we will look at developing an implementation plan that you can use with your discipleship group in the future.
\p In a brief conversation I had with Roy Moran who is the pastor of Shoal Creek Church near Kansas City, Missouri, he explained the problem with speaking simply about “multiplication” as a goal of disciple making. Multiplication implies a maturation process that takes a long time. First, we have an infant who must learn to walk and then run. He must learn the rudiments of knowledge before he can join with another of the opposite gender to produce offspring. Replication on the other hand is what viruses do. From the moment a virus is created it is looking for another cell to invade and cause a replication.
\b
\p \it Key to understanding church planting verses disciple making: \bd Churches multiply, but disciples replicate\bd*\it*\bd .\bd*
\b
\p Here is the key to understanding church planting verses disciple making. Churches multiply, but disciples replicate. We have seen in the first chapter of the gospel of John that the first thing, Andrew and Philip did was to go and call others to follow Jesus. They replicated themselves immediately. When Saul was given new sight in Damascus and following a few days with the disciples there, he began to proclaim that Jesus was the Son of God. (Acts 9:20)
\p However, there is another aspect to replication verses multiplication that is worth considering. Multiplication is a matter of numbers, whereas replication is a matter of DNA. What I mean is that the multiplication of numbers does not in itself guarantee that we will see the same life replicated in multiple generations. Maintaining fidelity to the basic principles of DMM requires that people remain faithful to the critical components of obedience, committing to memory the scripture stories to tell others, knowledge of the entire Bible and Jesus’ interpretation of it, adoption of Jesus’ mission of reconciling the world to God the Father through Jesus Christ and the making of disciples of Jesus.
\p It is easier to count numbers than it is to determine fidelity to being disciples of Jesus. In Paul’s second letter to Timothy that you will study in this chapter, Paul writes with the expectation that his time of ministry on this earth is coming to a close. Timothy, who is his closest associate, disciple, and personal friend, is receiving what might be Paul’s final counsel. Paul is concerned that the work that he has accomplished would not perish with Timothy. Replication depends on the character, faithfulness, and training of the people who will carry on.
\p Developing a relationship of accountability with the person of peace from the beginning is important. As the relationship develops, taking note of both his character and abilities is a continual part of the training process. You will see this in how he responds to the challenges he faces and how he interacts with you, other people, and what he is learning.
\p In the previous chapter, now take a few minutes to look at “A Disciple Maker Is,” the list of characteristics of a disciple maker. These are also the characteristics and attitudes that you are looking for and are trying to develop in your person of peace. Once the new discovery group is underway, your first goal in training the facilitator is to encourage growth in each of these areas:
\li Be a disciple of Jesus
\li Be passionately in love with Jesus
\li Be a servant of Jesus
\li Be obedient to Jesus’ commands
\li Be continuously learning
\li Be influential
\li Be a lover of people
\li Be a catalyst for planting churches
\p As Jesus shared in the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30), each person is given different amounts of abilities. Part of your job as a disciple maker is to recognize the facilitator’s span of abilities and to help him use what he has to the best advantage. In the parable, the servant who was punished, wasn’t punished for a lack of “talent,” but rather for his failure to use what he had. Like the parable, if a person refuses to extend themselves, investing time in them is of little use. Instead invest in people who are willing to develop the talent they have and are willing to step out and invest what they learn with others.
\p The second critical element in assuring that groups both multiply and replicate is to make sure that each facilitator is faithfully following all of the key parts of DMM. It is a serious mistake to leave out any of the parts of: memorization, telling others, or obedience at the beginning thinking that they can be added back in later.
\p Without the memorization and telling there is no replication and without the obedience there is little spiritual growth and personal transformation. These are the elements that transform a Bible study into a discipleship process and enable the members of the group to become disciples of Jesus and fulfill the Great Commission.
\p When a group of non-believers is just beginning, obedience may be sporadic, but the facilitator needs to hold to the standard. As getting comfortable with the discovery process takes a few times, so the members of the discovery group of even non-believers will grow comfortable with these parts of the process as well. A good thing about non-believers is that they usually don’t have preconceptions. In this regard, believers who have been in Bible studies may prove to be more difficult as they have to “un-learn” and adjust their expectations.
\p When you meet with the facilitator to prepare for the next study, you should also have him give you an update on what happened in the discovery group the last meeting and assure that the three critical elements of the discovery process (memorize, obey, tell) are being done consistently.
\p Among the things you need to know are any difficulties that arise in the group dynamics and any questions that he has. You should learn the names of each of the people in the discovery group of the person you are training. If there are specific personal needs in the group, you should learn about them as well. Prayer is a critical part of this process, so praying together with the person you are training and mentoring for the needs of the people in his group should be part of your training time. Even before he has discovered the need for prayer himself, you can model it for your person of peace by praying for the needs that he relates to you.
\p Moving past the first generation of discovery groups, you need to assure that the next two generations remain faithful to the basics of the process. When the person of peace that you have been mentoring, starts training and mentoring other facilitators who in turn are leading other discovery groups, besides reporting on the progress of his group, he needs to brief you on what the other facilitators are doing with their groups. Just as you are assuring compliance with the critical elements of his group, you should have him brief you on what he has learned from the facilitators he is mentoring and that they in turn are doing the same. In this manner you can reasonably assure that each group is reproducing faithfully.
\p One other tool to maintain fidelity of the groups is to make occasional visits. These should be very infrequent. Your role is simply to be an observer. Ideally, people in the group just see you as an interested visitor. While you are there, note the dynamics of the group. Is everyone participating? How is the facilitator doing? Is he using questions to draw people out? Is he assuring that the main lessons in the passage are being discovered? (These major points should be developed in your meeting with the facilitator before each of his discovery group meetings.)
\p Following your time observing the discovery group, in your next training meeting with the facilitator, debrief and share your observations. Ask him to evaluate what you observed and together decide what he can do to improve the dynamics of his discovery group. Remember this is a collaborative process. Especially as you are starting, you will both be learning together.
\p Watch videos 12, “Lack of Obedience” and 14, “Multiplication,” by Jim Yost.
\p In your group do another discovery study focusing on 2 Timothy 2:1-7; 14-16.
\p In addition to the standard questions about God and man, discuss how this advice to Timothy would apply to what you need to do. Read through the following passages and discuss their application to training a new facilitator as well as your own group’s goals.:
\li Matthew 13:3-23; Sower of seed, pathway, rocky, thorns, good ground
\li Matthew 21:19; - Cursing the fig tree
\li Matthew 13:31-33 – Mustard seed;
\li Colossians 1:6-7 – Epaphras a faithful brother
\li John 1:35-51 – Come and see
\li Spiritual Armor - Warfare -Ephesians 6:10-20. This is a good addition to your own group’s prayer.
\b
\p As you conclude your own discovery group time, take a few minutes to discuss what you have learned about facilitating a discovery group. The first obstacle in the discovery process is becoming comfortable with both the order of the process and in your ability to facilitate groups. Helping each other improve in facilitating a discovery group and understanding group dynamics is essential if you are going to lead a group of not-yet believers yourself or train a person of peace.

\p Making disciples is a process that involves several steps. The first one in which you are engaged is to become a disciple maker.
\p The second step is to find out where Jesus wants to visit; what group that he is sending you to. This is accomplished both by prayer and investigation. The “Community Prayer Guide” that you have worked on is the tangible fruit of this work.
\p The third step is the engagement of the people you want to reach. The final question in the discovery process, “do you know anyone who needs help,” is part of this step. This is effective when reaching neighbors, family members, or coworkers. It can be applied to reach into any community of people you are trying to engage.
\p Reaching out to a group with whom you don’t already have some social contact, requires initiating some type of engagement ministry. There are many that center around social services, medical, language acquisition, education help, etc. One of my colleagues is assisting an immigrant family who is having medical problems.
\p If there are already engagement ministries reaching the people you want to reach, involving yourself in their ministry either as a volunteer or disciple trainer of the engagement ministry staff is the quickest way to put your discipleship skills to work.
\b
\p The next step is to find a person of peace. As Jesus instructed us, we are to pray that the “Lord of the harvest sends workers into the field.” This is critical step prior to finding a person of peace.
\p In Chapter 10, we discussed that the next critical step in the process is to coach the person of peace in starting a discovery group in his “field;” his family or social network. This will involve developing his or her skills in facilitating a discovery group.
\p The process of the group member coming to Christ is part of the discovery studies. Your role as the disciple maker is to coach and work through the person of peace.
\p Baptism is a critical step. It marks the point at which a non-believer publically declare himself to be a believer and full disciple of Jesus. Depending on the culture this can put the people at risk of retribution from their native culture. This is true even in Europe, the United States, and Canada. It can mean social shunning, physical attack, or even death. Normally, you as the disciple maker would baptize the head of the discovery group and coach that person to baptize the remainder of the group, each one when they request.
\p At this point the group should be studying the “Discovering Obedience” series. As they begin studying the “Church Planting” series, the members of the group will both begin developing an identity in their group and develop more expertise in initiating other groups.
\p Your relationship with the person of peace will be changing throughout the entire process. As he matures, you may reduce the frequency of your meetings. As the group progresses through the multiplication step, he should be developing his own team of facilitators.
\p It is normal and desirable that some of the home groups will develop into churches. As this happens some of the groups may combine or meet together periodically. Once again this is all done on a discovery basis. Our relationship as disciple maker, with the groups and churches is strictly relational and confined to the emerging leaders of the group.
\p Home churches of 20 to 40 people are generally the most sustainable number of people. This size of group normally has enough social interaction to support growing families yet still fit into a home. Groups that do not reach this size often will disband over time. As long as the members take with them the same “DNA” of a discovery group, these individuals can become nucleuses for starting other groups.
\p Moving from a discovery group format to a house church format can be accomplished in several ways. Let the groups work out their own method of transitioning and forming a service based upon what they discover in the scriptures.
\p It is important that these new churches look for opportunities to multiply by starting other churches. Multiplication may slow, but it should not stop when a group becomes a church.
\p If the discovery group process has been diligently followed and members have been faithful to commit to memory, share and apply what they have learned in their studies of the Bible (See Appendix 2), they should arrive at the point of both reengaging their own community and sending out others to other adjoining communities. (You will recall from the “Community Pray Guide” that you identified other community groups that could be reached from this one.)
\ms2 Getting Started – Engaging the Lost
\p As we have mentioned, the passages that you have been studying in this book are designed for you to discover the disciple making process. Sharing these passages with “believers” is a good recruiting tool to find people who can join you in becoming and making disciples. However, to engage those who are not yet believers or followers, you will need to know and be able share some more basic passages.
\p When God started giving mankind his revelation, he started with the words in Genesis. Starting where God started has proven to be very productive in making disciples. Short-cutting the process and going immediately to the gospels or epistles may rapidly produce converts or believers, but rarely provides a sufficient foundation for people to become productive disciples of Jesus. The stories in the Old Testament also have a universal appeal to all sorts of people, so are excellent ways to build bridges into people’s lives.
\p As you and the members in your discovery group proceed to reach out to others, you will need to have a foundational knowledge in a few key Old Testament passages. That means that you need to include them in your personal and group discovery studies.
\p I have been deeply impacted by my studies of the Discovering God series. The effort to move beyond knowing and learning about the stories of the Old Testament, to making them part of my own identity has enriched my reading of all the other parts of the Bible.
\p Jesus and the writers of the Epistles had part of their foundational identities in these passages. This means that I now share not only in their understanding of God’s purposes, but also of a personal \bd identification\bd* with those purposes. Jesus’ purpose of reconciling the world to himself and his father, has become my purpose. When Paul says that it is no longer he that lives, but that Christ lives in him, I also share those sentiments and feelings.
\p In the six appendices that follow, there are resources for you to use. The first one is a format for implementation workshops. This document like all of those in the appendices is meant as a source of suggestions and a guide. You should use these “Workshops” as opportunities to transition your own discovery group from a training group to actually beginning to engage in reaching the lost. Strategizing, prayer, and feedback should be regular parts of your meeting times together.
\p It is important that your disciple-making discovery group continues on with implementation and reaching out to others, looking for people of peace. Networking discipleship discovery groups together is valuable for both prayer support and counsel when encountering challenging situations. The phenomenal success of DMM in Sub-Saharan Africa has been the result of the partnership of more than 300 churches and ministries in more than 19 countries. There are great advantages to linking up with other groups or organizations who are engaged in disciple making movements.
\p Watch video 1, “Cityteam‘s Animated Overview.”
\p The final study for your introduction to disciple making is John 15:1-11, in which Jesus strongly links abiding in him, with fruitfulness and discipleship. Nowhere in the gospels does Jesus specifically define what he means by fruitfulness, but here it is obvious that it characterizes the life of all of his disciples. It is abundant and it abides, enduring forever.
\p Keep in mind that it is cooperating with the Holy Spirit through the \bd five disciplines of a first century disciple of Jesus\bd* (Ch. 2 and following), that we arrive at the point where we are fruitful in making disciples who faithfully replicated what Jesus taught. Of these five disciplines, the most important is obedience to Jesus’ commandments and teachings in everything and at all times.
\p Since one of the roles of the Holy Spirit is to bring to mind all that Jesus has taught, we must have a deep knowledge of all of Jesus major teachings. It is the profound visceral, as well as intellectual, knowledge of Jesus’ teachings that enables us to obey as well as to make disciples.
\p A disciple of Jesus would endeavor to:
\li 1. \bd Obey\bd* all of the commands of Jesus
\li 2. To have an intimate knowledge of, and ability to \bd tell others from memory\bd*, all of the key teachings and commands of Jesus.
\li 3. To have a solid knowledge of the \bd Old Testament\bd* and to know and accept all of Jesus’ teaching about it.
\li 4. \bd Imitate and conform\bd* every aspect of the disciple’s life to that of Jesus. This especially means in adopting his mission as the disciple’s own; seeking to see, treat, and speak to people and God as Jesus did.
\li 5. \bd Make disciples\bd* of all the ethnic groups in the world, including your own. And as Jesus commanded his disciples, baptizing them, and teaching them to obey all the commandments Jesus gave.
\p In this discipleship process, Jesus limited our role as disciples to assisting the Holy Spirit and being a brother and servant to others who are engaged in becoming disciples of Jesus. We do this through the study and implementation of the words of the Bible into their lives.
\p So what are Jesus’ major teachings? We often refer to the words written in the Bible as the “word of God.” Jesus is also referred to as “The Word of God.” Obviously they are not identically the same, but there is an intimate connection. God the Father is the author and Jesus the Son is both the medium of communication as well as the incarnation of the word of God. Jesus said in John 14:24, “the words that you have heard from me are not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.” In a sense, all of the words in the Bible, then are Jesus’ words. Because they are the Father’s words they are intimately Jesus’ as well.
\p We cannot totally put aside the Old Testament as we live in the kingdom of God under the lordship of Jesus. Rather we must understand all of the teaching of the Old Testament through the lens of Jesus’ teachings. This is the third discipline of a first century disciple of Jesus. A disciple of Jesus would have a deep and extensive knowledge of all of the Old Testament; he would understand Jesus’ teachings about them and accept that understanding. Guiding people through the Old Testament to establish a foundation then is one of the preconditions for them becoming disciples of Jesus.
\p The fourth discipline, to imitate and conform to Jesus life cannot be better described than in the John 15 passage you have just studied. If we abide in him, he will abide in us. If we obey his commandments, we will abide in his love. In all of this we will come to abide in the Father’s love. In John 14 we learned that the Holy Spirit will be in us and the Father and Jesus will make their home in us.
\p This is the grace and power that works in and through us to transform us and accomplish the purposes of God in the world. We are indeed ‘saved by grace through faith’ and that grace both transforms us and enables us to work in an intimate partnership with Jesus and the Holy Spirit in establishing a bedrock of disciples upon which Jesus can build his church.
\p We learned in Matthew 16 that discipleship is the foundation upon which Jesus builds his church and that his church will attack and prevail against even the gates of hell. We learned that as disciples who learn to hear directly from Jesus’ heavenly father, we have tremendous authority both here on earth and in heaven. In the last verses of Matthew 28 we learn that the reason that we have such authority is because Jesus is with us always until the end of the age and he has been given all authority both in heaven and earth.
\p In Appendix 2 are lists of the six different discovery studies which are arranged in order that they would normally be studied:
\p \bd Discovering Disciple Making\bd*:
\p For most people whose orientation is to believe in one God, such as those who come from a Jewish, Christian, or Muslim background, the standard “Discovering God” series gives a solid basis to understand God and his purpose in sending his son Jesus. However, for those who believe in a pantheism of gods, such as Hindus, Shinto, Mormons, Animists and New Age believers, extra passages about God’s unity and distain for polytheism may need to be incorporated.
\p For people, such those with a Buddhist orientation or grew up in a Communist atheistic orientation, who have no concept of God, different passages may need to be added to explain the reality of God. The point of all of this is to say that part of your planning should be to evaluate the people you are guiding to a relationship with Jesus. Are there other passages that they should study that will give them the ability to fully discovery God? The standard “Discovering God” series is an excellent place to begin and if you don’t know what else to add or omit, you will have reasonable success using it.
\p The question now is how do you plan on going about growing as a disciple of Jesus and making other disciples? Take a few minutes to review the first Appendix, “Implementation Workshops.” The most important thing to keep in mind in everything you do in obedience to Jesus’ the Great Commission, is that it is your growing relationship with Jesus as his disciple that will enable you to best fulfill it.
\p The minimum size of your group should be two people. If you are married, your spouse counts as the second person. The optimum group size is six to eight people. This will provide prayer, personal and outreach support, discernment, and continuity in discipling the person of peace in case you are not available for a time.
\p If you are looking at engaging a large people group consisting of hundreds or thousands of individuals, assembling teams of people to engage them both in prayer and physically will improve your effectiveness still more. Look for other ministries who are reaching this group of people and form partnerships with them. As you are able and they are open, introduce them to disciple making movements. It is valuable if you establish a communications and accountability process with these networks of partnerships.
\p Above all seek to establish prayer networks. The best people to engage in this work are people who have a burden for the particular group that you are trying to reach. Join with other groups who are working to reach the same or similar groups of people to pray regularly.
\p As you begin reaching out start with the Discovering God Series in Appendix 2 and be prepared to share these passages from memory.
\li Genesis 1:1-25 God Creates the World
\li Genesis 2:4-24 God Creates Man and Woman
\li Genesis 3:1-13 Man and Woman Eat the Fruit
\li Genesis 3:14-24 God’s Curses
\p There is a small but rapidly growing number of books addressing Disciple Making Movements. I have found the following four to be extremely important in understanding and implementing disciple making movements. I have included quotations from each of them to give you an idea of their content as well as share a few of their important insights.

\periph Appendix 1: Implementation Workshops
\ms1 Appendix 1
\ms2 Implementation Workshops
\p \bd General:\bd* Plan on 12 to 14 implementation workshops with your group of disciple makers. The meeting times and dates need to fit your schedules. I suggest meeting biweekly to give yourselves time to implement what your group decides to do. Following are only suggestions, but may give you a place to start your own planning.
\p \bd First meeting:\bd* Determine the group of people you want to reach. Complete or review your “community prayer guide” that you should have started during this training (see Appendix 4). Determine what additional information you need about this group and how you will obtain it. If you have sufficient information, determine what series of scriptures would work best to engage them. (In addition to the standard Discovering God series, there are some topical studies that can be used to engage people which are available upon request: (jamesalilly3@gmail.com)
\li Follow the five part Discovery Group Guide:
\li Start with the \bd initial questions\bd* and write down your personal prayer requests as well as support each other in physical and material ways. This builds strong relationships with your team.
\li The second part – \bd Accountability\bd* is the place you can report progress with reaching people. When group members report needs, add these to you prayer list.
\li The third section, \bd Discovery Study\bd* should contain a review of one of the passages from the training seminar and a full discovery study on one of the passages you have selected to connect with people in your selected outreach community.
\li With \bd the review passage\bd*, (from the Discovering Discipleship series) focus on how you can implement this passage in your own lives as well as reaching others.
\li With \bd the outreach passage\bd*, (from the discovering God series) it is important to identify the essential elements of the passage, so that the facilitator (person of peace) of the community discovery group can be prepared to draw out his group members. These leading questions assure that there is a “minimum” of discovery in each passage. This is important as the new discovery group starts.
\li The fourth section: \bd Application and Obedience\bd* is time for brain storming and to make personal commitments on how to reach your target community.
\li The last session, \bd Outreach\bd*, is the time to discuss your plans to share the passage you are memorizing and make plans to better connect with your outreach community. Identify the needs and ways to meet those needs is a good place to start.
\li Close your time with a time of prayer for the needs of your group, but particularly for the needs of the community you are trying to reach.
\periph Appendix 2: The six standard discovery series
\ms1 Appendix 2
\ms2 The six standard discovery series
\p When developing lists of scripture passages to study, there is no one size fits all, and at all times right approach. There are topical studies such as marriage, parenting, and finances. The following four sets of basic discovery studies have been field tested and in general are adequate in guiding people from a monotheist background to discovery Jesus and moving on to forming a church and then reaching out to replicate the process in other places.
\p The following six sets of passages are to be used in context with the Discovery Group Process which is outlined in Appendix 5 and explained in Chapters 3 and 4. They are designed to move people incrementally into deeper understanding of God’s kingdom and purposes. In general, they are designed to take a person with no belief in Jesus and by means of a Biblically based discipling process, teaching people to obey the words they read and the things that the Holy Spirit shows them, leads them into a personal relationship with Jesus and then on to forming a church and continuing to reach out to other groups and cultures.
\p All of these series except the last are available at http://www.cityteam.org/dmm/.
\p \bd Discovering God:\bd* (Focuses on Old Testament into gospels) *The initial process of discipling people to Jesus begins with discovery of God, using select passage from Genesis through Acts 2. Depending on the background of the group of people being reached these lists may vary somewhat, but the goal remains the same, establish the practice of applying and sharing what the members of the group discover in what they read, and laying a foundation of understanding for the mission and accomplishments of Jesus.
\p \bd Discovering Obedience\bd*: (Focuses on the gospels) Once a person has discovered and accepted the relationship that Jesus offers and experienced his work of redemption and has committed his or her life to becoming His disciple rather than just applying what they discover about God, the second step is to discover what it means The Gospels
\p \bd Discovering Church Planting\bd* – (Focuses on the Acts and Epistles) – This series leads to a discovery of the essential components of becoming a church. It is this series that will lead many groups to actually become indigenous churches.
\p \bd Discovering Equipping Leaders –\bd* (Focuses on Matthew) – Presents Jesus as the model of leadership in order to form leadership skills.
\p \bd Discovering Leadership\bd* – (Focuses again on the gospels) - This series is designed to prepare people to fulfill the Great Commission

\ms1 Appendix 3
\ms2 Discovering Discipleship Scripture Questions:
\p These questions are meant to stimulate you to think about the passages being studied during your personal study time. They are not meant to be written out nor shared in the discovery group. Read the verses and then ask yourself the questions.
\p These do not replace the six basic questions: What is this passage about? What do we learn about God? What do learn about man? If this passage is true what will you change in your life? Who will you tell? And who will you help?
\ms2 Luke 10:1-11 - Disciple Making Process
\iq1 After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.
\li 1. After what? (Take a look at chapter 9.)
\li 2. Where might the 72 have come from, that is how were they recruited and developed?
\li 3. How were they to go out? Was there any hierarchy in how they were sent out?
\li 4. Where were they to go? How did they know?
\li 5. How can you know where to go?
\iq1 \v 2 And he said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
\li 6. Who were they praying for, themselves or others?
\li 7. If God was to send out laborers, who might they be?
\li 8. What did Jesus mean by “harvest?”
\li 9. What should be a regular part of your prayer life?
\iq \v 3 Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
\li 10. What does this indicate about the assignment?
\li 11. How does Jesus expect the 72 to operate?
\li 12. How could the 72 get through the midst of the wolves?
\li 13. What should you do when confronting challenges and dangers?
\iq \v 4 Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road.
\li 14. What did they have to rely upon?
\li 15. What might be some of the reason for Jesus to instruct them to “greet no one?”
\li 16. What should you do to obtain sufficient resources?
\iq \v 5 Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house!’
\li 17. Where was the ministry of the 72 to start?
\li 18. What is the first thing to say when entering a place on ministry?
\iq \v 6 And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you.
\li 19. What does it mean, “your peace will rest upon him?” What might this look like?
\iq \v 7 And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house.
\li 20. How does this compare with general “evangelism” that is practiced today?
\li 21. What does “hospitality” look like here?
\li 22. How should you react to hospitality?
\li 23. What does this say about ongoing relationship with the “person of peace”?
\li 24. How could you do this?
\iq \v 8 Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you.
\li 25. When might this be a challenge?
\li 26. What if you don’t like what is set before you?
\li 27. What do you learn about working in a different culture?
\iq \v 9 Heal the sick in it and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’
\li 28. How are you called to heal the sick?
\li 29. What are you called to proclaim?
\li 30. Is this the same as proclaiming salvation?
\li 31. What might be the connection between healing the sick and saying the “kingdom of God has come near?”
\iq \v 10 But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say, \v 11 ‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.’
\li 32. What does this tell you about where you expend your time and efforts?
\li 33. What is the consistent message that we are to proclaim whether we are received or not?
\li 34. How many commands of Jesus are there in this passage (verses 1-11)? What are they?
\p What other questions could you ask about this passage?
\p The six basic questions: What is this passage about? What do we learn about God? What do learn about man? If this passage is true what will you change in your life? Who will you tell? And who will you help?
\ms2 John 14:15–27 – Obedience and our instructor
\iq “\it If you love me, you will keep my commandments.\it*
\li 1. Is it possible to love Jesus and not obey his commands?
\li 2. How can you “keep” the commandments of Jesus?
\li 3. What are some of the ones you know?
\iq \v 16 And “I will” ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, \v 17 even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him.
\li 4. Who will send the helper, the spirit of truth?
\li 5. What are the preconditions for Jesus to ask the Father?
\li 6. What do we learn about the Spirit of truth?
\li 7. What does Jesus mean by “the world?”
\li 8. What do we learn about what the world understands of spiritual matters?
\iq You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you.
\li 9. Jesus makes a statement here and gives a promise. What are they and what does this mean?
\iq \v 18 \it “I will not leave you as orphans; “I will” come to you.
\li 10. Is Jesus still with us?
\li 11. What does this mean to us as disciples?
\iq \v 19 Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me.
\li 12. What did this mean to the original disciples?
\li 13. What does this mean to us?
\iq Because I live, you also will live. \v 20 In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
\li 14. How important is Jesus’ resurrection?
\li 15. What does this mean to you personally?
\iq \v 21 Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and “I will” love him and manifest myself to him.”
\li 16. How can we have Jesus’ commandments?
\li 17. What does it mean to “keep” the commandments?
\li 18. How is obedience connected to loving Jesus?
\li 19. If we do these things what can we expect Jesus to do?

\iq \v 22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?”
\li 21. What do we learn about the way our mind works compared to that of God?
\iq \v 23 Jesus answered him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him. \v 24 Whoever does not love me does not keep my words.
\li 22. What is the result of Jesus’ Father loving us?
\li 23. Why doesn’t Jesus manifest or show himself to everyone?
\iq And the word that you hear is not mine but the Father's who sent me.
\li 24. If we memorize all of Jesus words and share them, whose words are we sharing?
\li 25. If memorizing-to-tell is a discipline of a disciple, what is Jesus modeling for us?
\li 26. What then is Jesus asking us to do?
\iq \v 25 “These things I have spoken to you while I am still with you. \v 26 But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.
\li 27. What is the role of the Holy Spirit?
\li 28. There are two related things that the Holy Spirit is to do, what are they? How do they differ?
\li 29. What is required for the Holy Spirit to “bring to [our] remembrance?” What are we responsible to do?
\iq \v 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.
\li 30. What is the difference between the peace of the world and Jesus’ peace?
\li 31. What should be the result of the peace of Jesus when we are in difficult or dangerous situations?

\ms2 John 1:35-51 – Becoming a Disciple of Jesus
\p \v 35 \it The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples,\it* \v 36 \it and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”\it*
\li 1. What was John’s role in Jesus’ ministry?
\li 2. What might he have been doing for his disciples?
\p \v 37 \it The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.\it* \v 38 \it Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, “What are you seeking?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”\it* \v 39 \it He said to them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.\it*
\li 3. What might be the unspoken communications between Jesus and the two disciples of John?
\li 4. The two are simply referred to as disciples not at disciples of John. What might this tell us about the general practice of being a disciple?
\p \v 40 \it One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.\it* \v 41 \it He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which means Christ).\it*
\li 5. What was the first response of Andrew?
\li 6. What does this tell us about inviting people to join us in becoming disciples of Jesus?
\li 7. Who might have been the second disciple of John.
\p \v 42 \it He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon the son of John. You shall be called Cephas” (which means Peter).\it*
\li 8. Simon means “one who hears.” The meaning of Simon’s name gives underlying content to some of the conversations between Jesus and Simon Peter. Also, note that Simon’s father is John. This will provide more understanding when you study Matthew 16.
\li 9. Who normally names a person? What does this tell about the new relationship between Jesus and Peter?
\p \v 43 \it The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him,“Follow me.”\it*
\li 10. In John’s account of the gospel, Philip is the first person Jesus called.
\li 11. What do we learn about being called verses choosing to follow Jesus and Andrew and the other disciple did?
\p \v 44 \it Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.\it*\v 45 \it Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\it*
\li 12. Philip like Andrew, immediately went and called his brother.
\li 13. Was Andrew’s call of Simon and Philip’s call of Nathanael a valid call to become a disciple of Jesus Jesus?
\p ”\v 46 \it Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”\it*
\li 14. What can we infer about the men of the region of Bethsaida in terms of their interest in the messiah?
\p \v 47 \it Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!”\it* \v 48 \it Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”\it* \v 49 \it Nathanael answered him,“Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”\it*
\li 15. What do we see in the way Jesus was working through Philip? Does this support or change your earlier decision about the validity of coming to Jesus via an invitation of another disciple? (question xiii.)
\li 16. What role does the supernatural play in these five men becoming disciples of Jesus?
\p \v 50 Jesus answered him, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” \v 51 And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”\it*
\li 17. What is Jesus preparing the disciples for?
\li 18. What should we be prepared for?
\p What other questions could you ask about this passage?
\p The six basic questions: What is this passage about? What do we learn about God? What do learn about man? If this passage is true what will you change in your life? Who will you tell? And who will you help?
\ms2 Matthew 23:8–11 – Our role in discipleship
\p \it But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers.\it* \v 9 \it And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.\it* \v 10 \it Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ.\it* \v 11 \it The greatest among you shall be your servant.\it*
\li 1. In terms of discipleship, who is to be our teacher and instructor? (ref John 14:26)
\li 2. What is our role in the discipleship process?
\li 3. What does this mean practically for us in the discipleship process? How do we implement this?
\p What other questions could you ask about this passage?
